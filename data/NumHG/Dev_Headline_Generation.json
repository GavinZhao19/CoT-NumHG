Allman, who spread a message of non-violence, also has written a book called Amazing Grace about female victims of domestic violence, notes the Mercury News.

He is not in solitary confinement and he is not in isolation. He is in a cell which I believe is next to the infirmary where he can come and go from the cell to the infirmary.  The nearest juvenile detention facility is 80 miles away. The boy has been provided with coloring books and other forms of entertainment, and while he understands where he is, he's acting like a normal 10-year-old and talks about his prison outfit  being a Halloween costume,  says his lawyer.

The firms learned of the presence of polonium-210 in cigarettes in 1959, and they examined the radioactive material's effects during the 1960s, documents show. They found that it caused  cancerous growths  in users’ lungs, and figured out just how much radiation a typical smoker would inhale, but the companies didn’t warn the public. Using the original calculations, the researchers determined that the radiation would lead to the deaths of 138 of every 1,000 smokers over 25 years, ABC News reports. Not only are you inhaling it, but  you're emitting radiation when you smoke, and your family, your dog, your cat are all inhaling that radiation,  says an expert. What’s more,  some of these radiation particles hang around for decades.  The timing of the original discovery is notable, says an anti-smoking advocate: It happened in an era when Americans  were crawling under our desks during school radiation drills,  meaning the news would have likely had a huge impact. Polonium remains in cigarettes, and a rep for Philip Morris says it’s no secret to public health experts. It’s  a naturally occurring element found in the air, soil, and water,  says the spokesman.",

The study of 125 women expands upon what the BBC reports are some fairly broad stats: Only 4% of women actually deliver when predicted, and 30% do not give birth within 10 days of their due dates. As LiveScience explains, that variation was previously attributed to inaccurate calculations of the baby's age. But the US National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences study used urine samples to determine precise ovulation and implantation dates, and, after excluding premature births, found the natural gestation period varied by up to 37 days. (The average ovulation-to-birth time was 268 days. The study also found there was a link between gestation length and the age of a mother, the weight she was at birth, and the time it took for embryos to implant.  The emphasis on a single due date may make the length of pregnancy seem more predictable than it really is,  says a study researcher. The upshot? Perhaps a  delivered by  date would be better than a  due date,  suggests a spokesperson for the UK's Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.",

The two planes were, at one point, only 200 feet apart, a federal official says.  The two aircraft were turning away from each other at the point where they lost the required amount of separation,  the FAA said in a statement.

The fetus, which reportedly had developed to the point of having hair, legs, hands, and genitals, was surgically removed from the 15-year-old boy, according to Fox News, which quotes a report by Central European News.  The fetus removed from my son’s stomach was formed with organs like those of a baby—only the nose and mouth were not complete,  the teen's mother says. This is believed to be the first case of  fetus in fetu  known to have occurred in Malaysia, Medical Daily reports, noting that it happens about once per 500,000 births. Medical Daily explains the fetus in this situation is typically  located in the retroperitoneal area—or the space between the membrane lining the cavity of the abdomen and the posterior abdominal wall.  Indeed, Mohd Zul Shahril Saidin had an  oddly rounded shape tummy  and had periodically sought medical attention since he was a year old, Malaysian Digest reports. According to the Digest, the teen had been able to live an active life as a child, including playing sports, but his protruding stomach had more recently begun to interfere with his movement and the pain intensified last month. The family, which has a total of eight children, held a funeral for the fetus, which is now buried at a cemetery, the Mirror reports. (This preserved fetus likely is the youngest Egyptian mummy.)",

It was last seen on radar at 6:16am, and a minute later was no longer there, he said. Darkness has fallen in the region, reports the BBC, and the search has been called off for the night.

It has become the stuff of legend, but the tale of what happened on a two-month journey of more than 3,000 miles—in an open boat, no less—has contained  a number of inaccuracies, exaggerations and inventions,  probably due  to the scarcity of first-hand material,  University College London researcher Tim Causer explains. That should no longer be an issue. Though the popular story is based on an edited version of one survivor's account, today, that first-hand account—the only thought to exist in relation to the first convicts deported to Australia in 1788—was released in full for the first time, AFP reports. The story  is often told with a focus upon the figure of Mary Bryant,  Causer notes. To wit, the Australian government presents a bio of Bryant, who was arrested for stealing a cloak and married husband William, also a convict, shortly after getting to the colony. They escaped on March 28, 1791, along with their two children and six others, by stealing the governor's cutter boat. The group paddled Australia's coasts until they landed at the Dutch settlement of Kupang on West Timor. For a time, they tricked their hosts into thinking they were shipwreck survivors, but were shipped back to England when the truth came out; four convicts and the two children died on that part of the trip. The account was likely recorded for survivor James Martin by prison officials upon his return to England, and  it matches up with newspaper accounts and other primary sources,  says Causer, who hopes Memorandoms by James Martin  will help to create a more rounded story.

We counted 232 teeth,  17-year-old Ashik Gavai’s doctor tells the BBC. At one point, they also took a chisel and hammer to remove fragments of a  marble-like  structure in the boy’s jaw, the Telegraph reports. The surgery took seven hours and a four-person medical team in a Mumbai hospital. Turns out Gavai, from a village in western India, had a complex composite odontoma—basically a benign tumor. It usually forms in the upper jaw and causes the gums to make lots of teeth, and it could’ve damaged Gavai’s jaw bone, the Mumbai Mirror reports. Gavai’s 18-month saga had become a cancer scare for his parents, who took him to Mumbai when the village doctors couldn’t figure out what was causing swelling in the right side of his jaw. A month ago the swelling caused severe pain, and that’s when his parents feared the worst. Now that Gavai is back to having the normal 28 teeth, he’s not out of the woods.

A 15-year study of half a million British women finds that a woman who has undergone a tonsillectomy or appendectomy has a 49% and 34% higher chance of getting pregnant, respectively, than a woman with her appendix and tonsils intact, reports the Telegraph. A woman who's had both procedures has a 43% higher chance of getting pregnant. One of the researchers says the study  confirms beyond doubt that removal of inflamed organs or organs likely to suffer from repeated inflammation, in women, improves their chances of pregnancy  rather than reduces those chances, as some doctors believe. It isn't clear why the procedures are linked to increased fertility—doctors previously suggested scar tissue around the fallopian tubes after an appendectomy reduced the chance of pregnancy—but it may simply be that women who have more sex are more likely to develop an infection. However, inflammation in the body can affect a woman's ovaries and womb, per the BBC, and it's possible that  the removal of these tissues makes an alteration to their immune system  that affects reproduction, says a scientist not involved in the study.  If true, this may ultimately give doctors and scientists some new ideas for novel drugs or therapies to enhance women's fertility.  The researchers stress they're not advocating that otherwise healthy women have the procedures, notes CNN. (This procedure may double a woman's chance of conception.)",

Researchers found that species are vanishing around 10 times faster than previously believed—and 1,000 times faster than they did before humans emerged, the AP reports. A mass extinction on the scale of the one that wiped out the dinosaurs is close, and  whether we avoid it or not will depend on our actions,  says the lead researcher. Habitat loss is the main factor causing species to disappear, but climate change, overfishing, and the spread of invasive species also play a role. But the situation isn't completely hopeless: Modern technology and  citizen scientists  are helping biologists locate endangered species, aiding efforts to save their habitats, the study author tells National Geographic. Thanks to mobile apps like iNaturalist and online crowdsourcing,  we know where the species are, we know where the threats are, and—even though the situation is very bleak—we are better able to manage things,  he says. What can the average citizen do? A scientist not involved in the study suggests encouraging lawmakers to connect nature reserves to each other, and the study author notes that extinction rates of mammals, birds, and amphibians are 20% lower than they would be without protected refuges.

The EU announced it will ban the export of technology for military use to Russian arms-maker Kalashnikov (maker of the AK-47) along with eight other companies, restrict access to financial markets for state oil firms Rosneft and Gazprom Neft, and put asset freezes and travel bans on 24 Russian officials and rebel leaders in Ukraine, Reuters and the BBC report. Members of Putin's inner circle are among the targets, including Sergei Chemezov, chairman of arms group Rostec. A battle-tank manufacturer and an aerospace firm that makes military helicopters were also hit.  I never felt before this level of solidarity,  Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko said of the news. But as some EU members worry Russia could retaliate—the country has suggested it could bar Western airlines from Russian airspace, the AP reports—the EU says the sanctions will be eased if the ceasefire with Ukraine holds. The US is also expected to hit defense companies and arms makers with its own sanctions later today  in light of Russia's actions to further destabilize Ukraine over the last month,  President Obama says. The US will reportedly limit Russian bank Sberbank's access to US equity and debt markets and tighten restrictions on other Russian banks, the Guardian reports.",

That's because the 47-story structure, due to open in December, lacks a working elevator. Or more precisely, it has one for the first 20 floors, reports the Daily Mail, but after that, residents will have to hoof it because of a rather massive design oversight: The elevator shaft is too narrow to accommodate the machinery for a bigger one. The InTempo project has been an absolute mess from the start, beset with bad loans, missed deadlines, deadly construction accidents, and bankrupt builders, reports El Pais, which gets into the details. The elevator problem in particular stems from a simple fact, explains Gizmodo: The building was originally supposed to be only 20 stories, but when developers increased it to 47 stories mid-stream, the design snafu got lost in all the confusion. InTempo is now 94% complete and has sold 35% of its apartments. It remains unclear how developers plan to fix the elevator problem, or whether it's even possible to do so.

What allegedly happened in the hours after that is both confusing and dreadful: Price, a gospel singer, says she was told by a nurse the baby died shortly after birth, and she went home heartbroken.

Jackson goes on to explain that, with a name given to Gilmore by her adoptive parents, Gilmore's kids searched for her biological mother and confirmed it was Price with DNA testing. Jackson also posted a video on Facebook on March 7 that shows how they broke the good news to Gilmore, as well as her first emotional face-to-face with Price via computer.

But instead of songs like  Never Gonna Give You Up,  the tape the 21-year-old put together on a home four-track recorder features weird sound effects and bits and pieces of eclectic songs that range from a somewhat obscure 1966 single ( The Men in My Little Girl's Life  by Mike Douglas) to George Michael's  I Want Your Sex  to the Andy Griffith Show theme song. Dangerous Minds last week showcased  Montage of Heck  in full, along with a complete list of what's included on it, and writer Martin Schneider says the mix tape is more like an  unbelievably wacked-out sound collage.  It was reportedly recorded in June 1988, as Cobain was working on tracks for Nirvana's debut LP, Bleach, which would come out a year later. Cobain put the tape together using his LP collection, manipulated radio recordings, sounds he himself created or recorded, and even  elements of Nirvana demos,  Schneider writes. Some of the snippets Cobain uncovered and used are  truly bizarre,  writes August Brown at the Los Angeles Times, making the mix tape  a cross between a zany late-night radio show and the coolest college radio station record collection you could ask for as a late '80s rock fan.  As many point out, the mix is especially impressive considering Cobain put it together in the pre-Internet era.  If you've ever longed for a journey into the deep, dark mind of late Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain, this might be the closest you'll get,  writes Marlow Stern at the Daily Beast. And, as James Grebey at Spin notes, it is indeed disturbing in parts:  There's a lengthy segment about three minutes in that's mostly a repeated retching sound.

Already the feds have prosecuted 903 people for fraud this year, which is 24% more than they nabbed in the entirety of 2010, and puts them on pace for an 85% jump for the year.  This was a fairly dramatic number of prosecutions,  one researcher tells USA Today. The Medicare Fraud Task Force has also secured 24 convictions this year, compared to 23 in all of last year.  That’s just a stunning number when you see it in the first eight months,  said Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer. The strides come in part thanks to the Democrats’ health care reform law, which created a new agency to hunt down fraud and expanded an existing one; the feds recovered some $4 billion last year because of their efforts. The FBI, meanwhile, says it’s shifted focus to criminal enterprises and major health care providers defrauding the government.",

Now, little remains of the fort—newly added to the National Register of Historic Places—beyond the trenches that were constructed to safeguard the guardsmen during the Coal Creek War, which had never been officially ended.

Bobby Berger, whose performances as Jolson created tension with the department in the 1980s, said yesterday that 610 tickets have been sold at $45 each for the Nov. 1 fundraiser in Glen Burnie, Md. But the venue involved, Michael's Eighth Avenue, says the fundraiser will not be held there.  No contract was signed with Mr. Berger,  a notice on its website said.  Michael's does not condone blackface performances of any kind.  Berger said he doesn't believe there's anything racist about his routine.  It's coincidence,  Berger said about the fact that the entertainer he impersonates wore blackface.  There's no racial overtones to this show.  Berger, who's 67, has performed the blackface act for decades and was fired from the police force in the 1980s for performing it in his spare time. He was reinstated following an appeal, and later retired. His performance at a retirement dinner for a white Baltimore County officer in 1996 prompted a black officers' group to protest. Berger said yesterday that he only intended to help the officers in the Gray case.  I want to get these people some money,  he said.  I know they need it, and that's the long and short of it.  Meanwhile, an attorney for the Baltimore City Fraternal Order of Police says officers don't support the fundraiser and that no money would be accepted from it.

So how far could he have gotten with that much cash? Jeremy Singer-Vine tackles the $725 question for Slate's Explainer column and comes up with ... Taiwan, assuming bin Laden was able to board a plane. Singer-Vine says the trip would start with a 70-mile-or-so ride from Abbottabad to Rawalpindi, for the cost of a $5 bus ticket. Once he arrived at the Daewoo bus terminal, it's about $7 to Islamabad International Airport via cab (though his driver would probably be wary of counterfeit euros, so bin Laden would have to take the time to exchange some into rupees). He could then catch a one-way flight to Abu Dhabi ($260), then on to Cairo or Alexandria ($260, $220); or he could fork over $400 to get to Bangkok, then fly to Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport ($220). Ending up in Egypt would get him 2,500 miles from the compound; Taiwan would slip in a little more distance, at 2,930 miles. Airport security too tough? He could also hit the road. Estimating 19 cents a mile for fuel, Singer-Vine says bin Laden could make it to Benghazi, Libya, in theory, in 10 days; but with the amount he'd likely have to fork over to bribe border guards, he probably wouldn't make it that far.",

This is an amazing and shocking and unique sample,  one geneticist and co-author of the study—published this week in the journal Nature—tells the New York Times.

By estimating the rate at which those DNA strands fragment, they came up with the interbreeding estimate of 50,000 to 60,000 years ago.

He then drove to a medical building, firing as he went, and killed one more soldier inside.  We do not know why he entered that building, and we may never know why,  a spokesman for the United States Army Criminal Investigation Command says. The spokesman says retracing the gunman's movements involved interviews with more than 1,000 soldiers, reports the Los Angeles Times.

The National Center on Family Homelessness report calculates that nearly 2.5 million American children were homeless at some point in 2013. That's based on the Department of Education's latest count of 1.3 million homeless children in public schools, supplemented by estimates of homeless preschool children not counted by the DOE. The problem is particularly severe in California, which has one-eighth of the US population but accounts for more than one-fifth of the homeless children—nearly 527,000. The federal government has made progress in reducing homelessness among veterans and chronically homeless adults, but  the same level of attention and resources has not been targeted to help families and children,  says a report author.  As a society, we're going to pay a high price, in human and economic terms.  Child homelessness increased by 8% nationally from 2012 to 2013, according to the report, which warned of potentially devastating effects on children's educational, emotional, and social development, as well as on their parents' health, employment prospects, and parenting abilities. The report ranked states on the extent of child homelessness, efforts to combat it, and overall level of child well-being. Minnesota, Nebraska, and Massachusetts scored the highest, while Alabama, Mississippi, and California scored the lowest.",

After the fall of the Gadhafi regime, however, a letter was found from the Belgian to Gadhafi offering the team's lobbying services to win US government support for the dictator. Livingstone—described in the letter as the  recognized best American anti-terrorism expert —says he hadn't seen the letter before this week, and it greatly distorts the team's intentions.",

The former Daily Show host and his wife, animal advocate Tracey MacShane, have agreed to adopt Lily, who was starving and half blind when she was abandoned at the New Holland Sales Stables auction site in Pennsylvania last month, LancasterOnline reports. The 20-year-old pony will live at the couple's Bufflehead Farm in New Jersey, which is home to dozens of other rescued animals. The Lancaster County SPCA says Stewart and MacShane decided to adopt Lily last month after visiting her at the Omega Horse Rescue and Rehabilitation Center, Fox 43 reports.

On Friday, 65-year-old Rhode Island man Philip Price Jr. was found guilty on counts including animal cruelty relating to his transport of the animal from New Jersey, reports WGAL, which notes that authorities have not determined who shot the pony with paintballs. Price was ordered to pay more than $10,000 toward Lily's rehabilitation costs. (Stewart and MacShane have also adopted a bull that escaped a New York City slaughterhouse.)",

The 2-1 decision by the 5th US Circuit Court of Appeals reverses a June order by US District Judge James Brady that ordered Woodfox's release. Brady had barred a third trial, saying the state could not try Woodfox fairly more than 40 years after the killing of guard Brent Miller. The 5th Circuit disagreed.  The district court abused its discretion by barring retrial and by granting the extraordinary remedy of an unconditional writ,  Judge Carolyn Dineen King wrote for the majority. In a dissent, Judge James L. Dennis said Brady's ruling should be upheld.  If ever a case justifiably could be considered to present 'exceptional circumstances' barring reprosecution, this is that case,  he wrote. Woodfox is the last still-incarcerated member of a group that supporters dubbed the  Angola Three  for their decades-long stays in isolation at the Louisiana State Penitentiary at Angola and other state prisons. The 68-year-old has consistently maintained his innocence in Miller's death. Judge Brady had noted that 43 years have passed since the crime, key witnesses have died, and there is no physical evidence linking Woodfox to the guard's stabbing.

The case is believed to be the biggest class-action lawsuit ever seen in Canada. Superior Court Justice Brian Riordan said in his decision that by choosing not to inform health authorities or the public directly of what they knew, the companies chose profits over the health of their customers. The judgment calls on the companies to issue initial compensation of more than $800 million in the next 60 days, regardless of whether they elect to appeal. The judge will decide at a later date how to distribute those funds. JTI-Macdonald, Imperial Tobacco, and Rothmans, Benson & Hedges say they will appeal. The Quebec case marked the first time tobacco companies had gone to trial in a civil lawsuit in Canada and involved two separate groups of plaintiffs: some of whom became seriously ill from smoking and others who said they couldn't quit.

The commercial real estate sector is tanking, with many properties unable to generate enough cash to make mortgage payments. Lo and behold, those commercial mortgages have been sewn into securities—comparable to the packages of home mortgages that set of the financial crisis last year—in a $700 billion market where delinquency rates are skyrocketing. As the Wall Street Journal reports, a commercial mortgage-backed security combines debt on several dozen properties, with big banks like Wachovia and Wells Fargo brokering transactions between borrowers and investors. Banks have so far been able to keep losses down by extending debt to borrowers, so long as the properties are bringing in a bit of cash. But barring a substantial uptick in hiring and shopping, commercial real estate is in trouble—and banks could be, too.",

When she was on the brink of adulthood, her high school principal and her husband—Toni and Juan Esparza—brought her into their family. In a Narratively piece titled  What it Feels Like To Be Adopted at 17,  Lyric, now a college grad who lives in Seattle, recounts her experiences of transitioning from a dysfunctional environment into a loving, supportive one. Lyric recalls an episode from when she was 7 years old in which a trip to Chuck E. Cheese gets sidetracked. Instead of games and prizes, the day ends with both of her parents being hauled away by the police.  I chased the cop car carrying my mom,  she writes.  The car was too fast to keep up with.  Some 10 years later, a high school counselor tasked Lyric with examining her life and family.  So I did,  she writes. She began to see how dysfunctional her home life was. Why hadn't her parents intervened when she was molested? Why did they buy new TVs when food and clothes were lacking? She also began spending more time with the Esparzas.  Their oddly peaceful demeanor,  she writes,  calmed me and fanned a little spark of hope in me that sang, 'One day, I’ll fly away.'  That day came after Lyric had a blowup with her mom when she was a high school senior. Her mom kicked her out and the Esparzas offered her a home, as their daughter. Five years later, in 2015, Lyric legally became an Esparza.  It took five years for me to realize that these people were serious about being my parents,  she writes.  I had found my way home.

Experts believe a significant amount of urine in popular Eichbaum Lake in northern Germany is linked to an algae bloom that poisoned the fish.  Swimmers who urinate in the lake are introducing a lot of phosphate,  a spokesman for the Hamburger Angling Association told Bild newspaper.  We're calculating half a liter of urine per swimmer per day.  Phosphate contributes to the build-up of blue-green algae. Swimmers are currently barred from the lake because of the algae bloom. But swimming enthusiasts claim anglers are promoting the leaky urine-algae link because they want the swimmers out of the water. Some environmental observers think the problem may be caused in part by ice skaters who wake up the fish during hibernation.

Nichols, the pilot of a hot air balloon that crashed over the weekend in Texas, killing 16, was able to keep flying despite having at least four convictions for drunk driving and twice spending time in prison—pointing to gaps in oversight of hot air balloon pilots, the AP reports. Whether the pilot's drinking habits had anything to do with the crash is unclear. A former girlfriend described Nichols as a recovering alcoholic and said he had been sober for at least four years and never piloted a balloon after drinking. The Federal Aviation Administration might allow a recovering alcoholic to fly commercial jets if the pilot was being successfully treated, says an aviation safety expert. But the agency is unlikely to accept an airline pilot with convictions for driving under the influence, he adds. Nichols, 49, got his commercial license to pilot hot air balloons in Missouri in July 1996. His first drunk-driving conviction came in 1990, followed by two more convictions in 2002 and a fourth in 2010, according to online court records. He was also convicted of a drug crime in 2000 and spent about a year and a half in prison before being paroled. He was returned to prison in April 2010 after his parole was revoked because of his drunk-driving conviction that year. He was paroled again in January 2012. Nichols also had a long history of customer complaints against his balloon-ride companies in Missouri and Illinois dating back to 1997. Customers reported to the Better Business Bureau that their rides would get canceled at the last minute and their fees never refunded. Investigators say they do not yet know why the balloon hit high-tension power lines before crashing early Saturday. (The victims included a newlywed couple celebrating a birthday.)",

The first known case of sexually transmitted Zika in the US was reported earlier this month in Dallas. The CDC is advising pregnant women to avoid sex or use a condom if their partners have been traveling to areas affected by the virus. Zika has been found in semen, and there is so far no evidence that infected women can pass it along to their sexual partners. Zika is most commonly spread by mosquitoes, though experts say a big outbreak of the virus is unlikely in the US. Meanwhile, the Puerto Rican government has outlawed  condom price-gouging,  meaning stores aren't allowed to raise the price of condoms, NPR reports. The government wants to slow the spread of Zika without allowing people to profit off the virus.  Now is not the time to raise prices,  one official says.",

Bjorn Kjos' master plan is to connect flights from smaller coastal US airports—New York's Westchester County Airport and Connecticut's Bradley International Airport have both been mentioned—that offer lower fees than busier airports to European destinations such as Bergen, Norway, and Edinburgh, Scotland. It's all part of the budget airline's blueprint to wrest trans-Atlantic market share away from larger airlines such as Lufthansa. Norwegian has 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets on order, with the first five set to arrive in 2017, the Telegraph notes. These planes are capable of flying over the ocean, but are more fuel-efficient and smaller, which would make them a better size for smaller airports like the one in Birmingham, England. Regulators would have to agree to the plan and set up customs stations at those US airports that don't currently handle international flights, but Kjos says he's sure that won't be an issue. A round-trip ticket will likely cost around $300 once all the fees are factored in, but that's still cheaper than the $500 or so that Norwegian's flights in and out of busier airports run, NBC notes.

The country already endures food shortages and a third of children are malnourished. The BBC notes the very fact that the country is mentioning the drought is evidence of its seriousness and perhaps a call for help. The UN offers North Korea about $50 million in aid each year, down from $300 million in 2004, but called for $111 million in April to fund humanitarian needs. South Korea also lends a hand, though some residents question that decision.

Further, the number of at-risk girls under age 18 more than quadrupled as compared to the 1990 numbers, per the study.

Though Congress made FGM/C illegal in 1996, the Guardian reports that  vacation cutting  is a way around this, where parents ship their girls to countries that allow FGM/C in order to have to procedure carried out. As for why the jump in risk, the CDC writes that  the estimated increase was wholly a result of rapid growth in the number of immigrants from FGM/C-practicing countries living in the United States and not from increases in FGM/C prevalence in those countries.

The Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation hopes that the 35th anniversary won't arrive with the crime still unsolved: On Monday its director revealed a  critical piece of evidence : a cable repair ticket book. At a press conference, Director Stan Florence explained that the book's final ticket logs work completed at the Neilsons' apartment at 11:51am on the day of her death, reports the Norman Transcript.

We want help in identifying those three letters, identifying who that person was that wrote in that book,  said Florence. The ticket book has been in the bureau's possession for years; under a state law that was altered in 2011, the bureau finally had the ability to share the evidence with the public in hopes it will bring closure to the case. The bureau said it received a number of calls within a day of revealing the ticket. The Oklahoman reports that the 21-year-old's throat was cut, and she had been stabbed a number of times.

The hospital argued that Brooks gave it unrestricted access to the money and only later asked that it build a women's center and name it after his mother, Colleen Brooks, who died of cancer in 1999. During the trial, Brooks testified that the hospital president initially suggested putting his mother's name on an intensive care unit, and when Brooks said that wouldn't fit her image, the president suggested a women's health center.  I jumped all over it,  Brooks told jurors in tearful testimony.  It's my mom. My mom was pregnant as a teenager. She had a rough start. She wanted to help every kid out there.",

Poul Nielson, a Danish politician given the task last year of preparing a labor market report for the Nordic Council of Ministers, puts forth  Proposal 7,  which states that the  Nordic governments should commit to the principle of mandatory adult and continuing training for everybody in the labor markets  in that area of the world.  The combination of rapid technological development with the gradual increase in retirement age increases the need for new forms of education,  he tells the EuObserver, noting people in their 60s may still have five to 10 more years in which they'll be collecting a paycheck. And while Nielson says it would be  visionary  for Nordic countries to adopt this proposal, which doesn't define how long or how often adults would have to submit to schooling, he's aware there will be critics and  expects many misgivings, conflicts of interest, and not least major difficulties when it comes to the allocation of costs and rights,  as the Nordic Labour Journal notes. But he points out the creation of a common Nordic workforce in 1954 was a similarly  out of the box  move and that having all adults of working age well-trained will help the region remain competitive globally. As for what the 73-year-old Nielson himself would study if he had to hit the books again:  photography or more gardening.  The Nordic Council is expected to directly address his proposal in November.",

The owner of the historic Center Lovell Inn and Restaurant is retiring after 22 years and plans to continue the tradition of passing the $905,000 property to the winner of an essay contest, Reuters reports. Until May 17, Janice Sage—who took ownership in 1993 after winning a contest initiated by the previous owner—is accepting 200-word essays on the subject,  Why I would like to own and operate a country inn,  reports the Boston Globe. Each entry must be  formally done and grammatically correct  and include a $125 fee, she tells NPR. She'll pick her 20 favorites and two locals will decide the winner from the bunch. Sage hopes to receive about 7,500 entries to cover the cost of the property plus a bit extra—the winner will also receive $20,000 to get started.  There are a lot of talented people that can't, just can't, go out and buy an inn like this,  Sage says.  Now all they need to do is write and convince me.  The winner is required to run the business for at least a year. That means 17-hour workdays of cooking meals, cleaning rooms, and looking after the old building and its barn, put up in 1895, along with numerous outbuildings on 12 acres. The owner will also have to keep the inn painted white but can choose between hunter green, forest green, or black roofing and shutters.  Unless you raise 14 kids, you're not going to be used to this,  Sage says. But at least the lucky winner can enjoy views of New Hampshire's mountains after a hard day of work. The winner will be announced May 21 with the transfer of ownership taking place within 30 days. (Also available: a $1.1 million trailer.)",

There, she recounted a life slowly sapped of former joys like long walks and gardening sessions.  Not to mention the hundred and one other minor irritations like being unable to stand for long, carry a heavy shopping bag, run for a bus, remember the names of books I have read, or am reading, or their authors.  She spent a last evening in Basel with her life partner John that he describes as  tranquil and enjoyable. ... Gill had been thinking about it for years and I had no intention of spoiling it by getting emotional and heavy.  Her daughter Caron, also a nurse, admits the decision was hard on her, but Pharaoh wrote in her blog post that while many parents expect their children to care for them in their old age, she would not to put that burden on her own kids.

The wide-ranging scandal surfaced when a teenage girl who described herself as a prostitute said she had sex with about 30 law enforcement officials in Oakland and elsewhere in the region. Alameda County District Attorney Nancy O'Malley said she was waiting to formally file charges until the teen could be returned to California from Florida, where she has been jailed in an assault case, the AP reports. The prosecutor said she needs the teen to provide testimony in the case. O'Malley said the officers who will be charged are former Contra Costa sheriff's deputy Ricardo Perez; former Livermore police officer Dan Black; Oakland police officers Brian Bunton, Giovani LoVerde, and Warit Utappa; and former Oakland police officers Tyrell Smith and Leroy Johnson. The officers will be charged with a range of felonies and misdemeanors, O'Malley said. The teen, now 19, said she had sex with four officers before she turned 18 and sometimes traded sex for protection from arrest or tips about planned prostitution stings. Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf previously said disciplinary action has begun against a dozen officers, including dismissal proceedings against four. Seven will serve a range of unpaid suspensions before being allowed to return to duty and another will be required to attend training classes. The Oakland department previously said two officers implicated in the scandal had resigned and another killed himself last year. The department cycled through three chiefs in 10 days in June after the allegations were first reported in the media. Six Richmond police officers and personnel at other law enforcement agencies have also been implicated.

Burwell. A rep for the Kaiser Family Foundation tells the Washington Post the new government figures offer the best assessment yet of how many Americans will be affected by such a decision.  These are the people we now know are receiving subsidies that would be lost if the court sides with the challengers,  he says. The plaintiffs argue residents of 34 states who bought coverage on the federal exchange aren't entitled to tax credits due to four words at the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Most who would be affected come from two large area groups: one covering Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Texas, the other covering Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Wisconsin. At an average of $272 a month, the subsidies total $1.7 billion per month. Some 2.1 million people would lose $595 million in subsidies per month in Texas and Florida alone. If forced to pay the cost of coverage in full, subsidized enrollees would face an average effective premium increase of 287%. Those in Alaska and Utah would face a 500% increase; Mississippi enrollees would see a 650% hike, researchers say. The Urban Institute estimates two-thirds of those receiving subsidies would give up their coverage without help, Politico reports. Those most at risk are white, employed, live in the South, and have modest incomes. If the Supreme Court revokes coverage, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Florida Gov. Rick Scott both say the federal government will need to come up with a solution. Pennsylvania is the only state to put forth a backup plan, reports the Hill. Gov.

Magritte's The Enchanted Pose was part of a 1927 exhibition, but no one purchased it, and it was returned to Magritte. Since 1932, its whereabouts have been unknown, leaving behind only a single black-and-white photograph as evidence. In 2013, two pieces of The Enchanted Pose—which shows two nude women standing next to each other—were discovered hidden beneath other Magritte paintings in the US and Sweden. The discovery of the third piece, the lower right corner, was announced Thursday. The new piece of The Enchanted Pose was discovered by art conservator Alice Tavares da Silva, who was inspecting a Magritte painting called The Human Condition before it was loaned out to another museum. She discovered paint on the side of the canvas under the frame that didn't match the painting itself. Artnet News reports it's rare for a Magritte work to have paint on the edges. An X-ray of The Human Condition revealed it was painted over a piece of The Enchanted Pose. Tavares da Silva calls it a  hugely exciting discovery.

He lost that battle on Friday, dying at the age of 17—well past the 13 years that children with the disease are expected to live, and the day before he was to serve as honorary captain at a New England Patriots game. The Massachusetts teen became the face of the rare condition, which causes super-speed aging and is thought to currently afflict just 250 children around the globe, after appearing in HBO's Life According to Sam; he also gave a TED Talk last month in which he shared his philosophy for a happy life. NPR's Eyder Peralta writes that the 2013 documentary  revealed a funny, sober boy.  It followed him and his parents for a period of three years; his parents, both doctors, formed the Progeria Research Foundation in 1999 following his diagnosis at 22 months. In September, NPR reported on the first drug, lonafarnib, that had been found to help treat children with progeria; it bolstered their heart and bone health and allowed them to gain some weight. Those with the disease can weigh as little as one-third their normal weight, and in his TED Talk, Sam revealed he weighed just 50 pounds. That created an issue for him: His dream before high school was to play snare drum in the marching band, and regular snare drums and harnesses weigh 45 pounds. But  nothing was going to stop me.  So he worked with an engineer to design a version that weighed just six pounds. Said Sam,  I have a very happy life.

How they went about doing so is revealed in Karen Masterson's new book, The Malaria Project, which reports on the operation of the same name. Making use of National Archives records, Masterson documents how US troops and mental patients were used as pawns in the effort. Because malaria can't be grown in cultures, live subjects were needed: Strains were extracted from troops who had been exposed to malaria while abroad and then injected into thousands of mental patients and prisoners. But many troops also became unknowing test subjects, with devastating results:  Some of the guys were ruined, sent home because they had so many malaria relapses,  says Masterson.  Their bodies were wrecked.  As Time reports, doctors set out to test the top 100 potential drugs out of 14,000 compounds that had been made. Some troops were dosed with  Mary  (sulfamerazine), others with Atabrine. At best, the treatments were useless; at their worst, they left troops wrecked by organ damage. Masterson estimates 10% of infected mental patients died (she didn't record any troop deaths). What ultimately worked was what Masterson calls a  magic formula  stolen from the Nazis: Chloroquine  went on to save more lives than any other drug in history,  she tells NBC News, though malaria-causing parasites eventually developed resistance to it. While the existence of the project was previously known, the book's fresh details will  renew debate over the ethics of using unsuspecting people as test subjects,  observes NBC.

Each year, federal agencies are required to estimate the amount of improper payments they issue; the House Oversight subcommittee on government operations is holding a hearing on improper payments this afternoon. Some improper payments are the result of fraud, while others are unintentional, caused by clerical errors; others were deemed improper because they were issued without proper documentation. The Obama administration has reduced the amount of improper payments since they peaked in 2010 at $121 billion. Still,  the federal government's own astounding estimate is more than half a trillion dollars over the past five years,  said Rep. John Mica, the Republican chair of the subcommittee.  The fact is, improper payments are staggeringly high in programs designed to help those most in need—children, seniors, and low-income families.

It all boiled down to a single liquid: After all,  ink is two times more expensive than French perfume by volume,  he tells CNN. Suvir collected random teachers' handouts, then picked out the most commonly used letters—e, t, a, o, and r—and used four different fonts to determine which typeface used the least ink. He even weighed the printouts and graphed the ink usage, and with its thinner strokes, Garamond was the clear winner.

But here's the kicker: When Suvir applied his findings to documents from the Government Printing Office—the Government Services Administration spends an estimated $467 million annually on ink—the results were basically the same.

But the safety part is now uncertain for some: The Consumer Product Safety Commission has ordered a recall of 1.5 million bikes in the US, Canada, and Mexico from 13 different brands sold between 1998 and this year, Gizmodo reports. It's the biggest group recall acted upon by the industry, the director of the Bicycle Product Suppliers Association tells Bicycle Retailer, all from a third-party front-wheel lever that can open during one's ride and get stuck in the disc brake's holes, possibly  causing the front wheel to come to a sudden stop or separate from the bicycle, posing a risk of injury to the rider,  per the CPSC notice. Affected brands include Cannondale and Diamondback. Just one incident with injuries has been reported so far, the Wall Street Journal reports. The same issue and an accompanying recall occurred in April with almost a million Trek bikes that also used the vendor-supplied lever, Outside reported at the time, with Gizmodo adding that  this seemingly simple problem—where a generic-brand lever interacts with a newer brake design—illustrates how sticky it can be to integrate old and new technology into a single product.  A dedicated website from the BPSA, which is helping organize the recall, offers a video and detailed instructions to help consumers determine if their bikes are affected. Those who are shouldn't panic: Per a BPSA press release, all one has to do if a malfunctioning lever is discovered is stop riding the bike and take it to the dealer, which will replace the lever  in as quick as five minutes.",

Although Obama has visited mosques overseas in the past, he waited until his final year in office to make such a visit at home, reflecting the sensitivity of the issue, reports the AP. At the Islamic Society of Baltimore, Obama sat down around a large table with Muslim university chaplains, community activists, and public health professionals for a discussion about religious tolerance and freedom. An afternoon speech will address how the US can more successfully confront extremism if it works with Muslims instead of branding all of them as potential enemies. One of the participants meeting with Obama, Ibtihaj Muhammad, has qualified for a spot on the United States Olympic Team for the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games. The White House said she'll make history as the first United States Olympian to compete in a hijab. (See this Buzzfeed profile on the fencer.)

This development  doesn't surprise me at all,  his mom, Kathleen Sneddon, says, though she concedes  part of the article may be correct and part of it may be conjecture.  When Sneddon, originally from Nebraska, went missing while hiking in China's Yunnan province, local officials shrugged and said he probably drowned. But his body was never found, and his parents kept the faith that their son was still alive. Rep. Chris Stewart of Utah is leading the push for US government intervention, sponsoring a House measure to look into Sneddon's whereabouts (there's a similar measure being bandied about in the US Senate).

Barry Beach, 53, told reporters gathered outside the Montana State Prison's front door that the moment was  surreal.   I knew it was going to be here someday,  Beach said.  The good Lord in heaven has always assured me that I'd reach this point. I never dreamed it was going to take this long.  He added there would be  a lot of healing and lot of tears  during the four-hour drive to his Billings home, and he thanked Gov. Steve Bullock for keeping his word. The governor, who was not present, previously said he'd look favorably on Beach's request. Beach was serving a 100-year sentence with no possibility of parole for the 1979 beating death of Kimberly Nees, 17, on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeast Montana. Bullock noted in his order that Beach was only 17 at the time and exhibited good behavior in prison. The murder of Nees, an honor student, gripped the small town of Poplar after her body was found alongside a river at a popular place for teenagers to party. No arrests were made, and small-town gossip built until Beach confessed to out-of-state police who picked him up on an unrelated crime. But Beach said his 1983 confession in Louisiana was coerced. A cousin of the victim said Friday it was shameful Beach had been released without someone else being charged in the crime.",

But now there's a new problem in the mix: a possible famine, created by what Ertharin Cousin, the executive director of the UN's World Food Programme, calls a  perfect storm  of  lack of staple food, access to clean water, and a diminished fuel supply.  In a press release, WFP estimates there are nearly 13 million of what it calls  food insecure  people in the war-torn country, with almost half in especially dire straits. That includes 1.2 million kids who suffer from  moderate  malnourishment and half a million who are severely affected.  The damage to Yemen's next generation may become irreversible if we don't reach children quickly with the right food at the right time,  Cousin says.  We must act now before it is too late.  Cousin saw the crisis firsthand during a recent three-day trip around the country, where she met with displaced families, moms and malnourished kids in hospitals, and people gathered at food-distribution centers. The UN's humanitarian chief also recently returned from Yemen and told the UN Security Council yesterday that  the scale of human suffering is almost incomprehensible,  per the BBC. Semantics means the WFP can't call the situation a full-fledged famine just yet: Per the UN, a food crisis is only considered as such if one-fifth of households have limited ability to deal with  extreme  food shortages; acute malnutrition rates surpass 30%; and the daily death rate is more than two per every 10,000 people. Continued conflict in Yemeni ports has exacerbated the problem, the BBC notes, with a WFP ship hammered by airstrikes Tuesday night in Hodeida.

And while cops mull whether Greer will be charged or let off for self-defense in Miller's death, there’s another major question to answer: whether 28-year-old Miller actually was pregnant. Despite her desperate appeal to Greer as she tried to flee, police say she didn’t appear to be with child and that an autopsy will clear up if she was. (Update: That autopsy has found she was not pregnant, reports Fox News.

The complaint states Marie Hatch moved into her Burlingame cottage more than 60 years ago at the request of her friend Vivian Kroeze, who owned the property and needed companionship after her husband died. Hatch was promised a lifetime tenancy, and the promise was honored by Kroeze's daughter and granddaughter after Vivian Kroeze died in 1980. But in 2006, the granddaughter was murdered by her boyfriend and her estranged husband, David Kantz, took over collecting rent. This month, Kantz's attorney told Hatch and her 85-year-old roommate to vacate within 60 days. Kantz previously told the San Francisco Chronicle that he felt terrible about evicting the women but had no choice given that the agreement is not in writing and he has to provide for his sons. The newspaper's story prompted calls and emails from hundreds of people offering help. One call came from a Joe Cotchett, a high-profile civil attorney whose firm is representing Hatch free of charge.  This is one of the most egregious acts of taking advantage of one of our community's most vulnerable citizens that I have seen in my legal career,  one of Hatch's lawyers says. The complaint claims elder abuse as well as breach of contract.",

But everyone missed the larger point: Melissa King was just 18 when she supposedly filmed it, writes Charles Lane in the Washington Post.  Why is it even legal to cast an 18-year-old in a sexually explicit movie?  he wonders. Eighteen might be the age at which you can vote, but certainly  having sex with a stranger for money and on camera belongs on the short list of risky behaviors that one can’t legally engage in before age 21,  like drinking, gambling, working as a stripper, or buying a gun. Congress set the minimum age to participate in porn at 18 in 1984, back when it took a lot more time, effort, and money to make a porn film. These days, anyone can film a sex act on a cellphone camera and distribute it on social media.  Mistakes like King’s are much easier to make but much harder to erase,  Lane writes. It's time for Congress to recognize  the immaturity and vulnerability of some 18- to 21-year-olds  by changing the porn age. Click for Lane's full column.",

According to officials in Kaohsiung, the six men, led by a senior member of the United Bamboo triad gang, killed themselves at the end of a 14-hour standoff in which they took two guards hostage and seized four rifles and six handguns from the prison's weapons cache, the BBC reports. During the standoff, the inmates agreed to exchange the two hostages for the prison's warden and head guard, who had volunteered to take the places of the guards the inmates seized after faking illness yesterday. The men, who were all serving sentences of 25 years to life for crimes including murder, had demanded safe passage out of the prison and complained about issues including low prison wages. They also complained about the release last month of former president Chen Shui-bian after just six years of a 20-year sentence for corruption, the BBC reports. According to the Diplomat, the only request authorities honored was one for two bottles of liquor, made when the men released their hostages just before dawn today.

Their mother, 72-year-old Geraldine  Jerri  Kramer, gave birth to a baby in 1963, when she was 19 and unwed, but the Indiana woman's parents and priest made her give the boy up for adoption. Still, she bonded with the infant as soon as she held him, and never stopped thinking about him, she tells ABC News. Kramer, whose maiden name was Hummel, called the baby Jack, Fox News reports. He remained a secret from much of her family, even the husband she married in 1966. But in 1988, when her oldest daughter was considering giving up a child for adoption, Kramer told her the story and warned her daughter she'd regret parting with the baby. Then, as her health started to decline, Kramer asked her kids to help her find her own lost child. The five of them took a group photo on Thanksgiving and added the words,  You were born 6-10-63. You're our older brother, we're looking for you.  They posted it on Facebook, where it's been shared nearly 45,000 times.  You were born June 10, 1963 in the wee AM hours, at Marion County General Hospital, in Indianapolis, Indiana. You were placed for adoption through Catholic Social Services,  reads the post.

But there’s a catch: It costs $10 million per injection well, a price the energy industry isn’t likely to pony up gladly, Reuters reports. It's not the actual fracking, but the disposal of contaminated fluids—which are typically pumped deep into the Earth—that seems to be causing the quakes. So seismologists say that if companies conducted a thorough seismic survey before pumping drilling fluid into the ground, they could make sure it’s not going to hit quake-prone areas. But the process is both more costly and more involved than the oil companies’ usual method of drilling a bore hole to collect a limited rock sample, and companies aren’t likely to do more until the link between fracking and earthquakes is definitively proven. It hasn’t been yet, but the evidence is strong: Every region where fracking has taken off has seen quakes increase tenfold.",

In addition to the fine, Nugent will produce public service messages to air on his television program, Spirit of the Wild, be banned from hunting in Alaska or on any US Forest Service land for one year, and be placed on probation for two years. The problem came on a hunting trip to Tongass National Forest in May 2009 when Nugent wounded one black bear with an arrow, then shot and killed a second bear four days later, exceeding his bear quota and making the second bear illegal. (All of it aired on TV.) Nugent's lawyer called the law  crazy  and said Nugent's arrow only  touched  the first bear, so lightly the bear did not leave a blood trail as it got away. He noted that Nugent has hunted in Alaska for years and was not aware of the new law, which is less than five years old. (Click to read about Nugent's chat with the Secret Service.)",

NPR reports it was a 7.2% increase over 2014—the largest single-year increase since 1966 and, according to a press release, the end of a 50-year downward trend in traffic fatalities.  Despite decades of safety improvements, far too many people are killed on our nation’s roads every year,  US Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx says. Officials say the increase in deaths is attributable to more people driving due, in part, to job growth and cheaper gas, both of which lead to more young people driving and more people driving for non-work reasons. People are also driving longer distances, on average. Nearly half the traffic fatalities in 2015 were passengers who weren't wearing seat belts. And approximately 30% involved a drunk driver.  The data tell us that people die when they drive drunk, distracted, or drowsy, or if they are speeding or unbuckled,  a NHTSA administrator says.

The study is the first national estimate based on a new term,  alcohol use disorder,  in a widely used psychiatric handbook (DSM-5) that was updated in 2013. Researchers from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism asked 36,000 adults during 2012 or 2013 about lifetime drinking habits, including current or within the past year. About 14% of adults were current or recent problem drinkers, or nearly 33 million nationally, and 30%—almost 69 million—had been at some point in their lives. Drinking problems were most prevalent among men, whites, and Native Americans. Low-income adults, those younger than 30, and those who never married also relatively high rates. Problem drinking also was more common among city dwellers than those in rural areas, while the West and Midwest had higher rates than other regions. The new handbook defines problem drinkers or those with the disorder as people with at least two of 11 symptoms, including drinking that harms performance at work, school, or home; frequent hangovers; and failed attempts to limit drinking.

A new study offers some illumination: It suggests a hot, unpredictable climate and high carbon dioxide levels kept some of the world's first dinosaurs away—and may shed light on our own issues with climate change. Researchers first analyzed ancient sedimentary rocks in New Mexico, which would have been much closer to the equator as part of the supercontinent Pangea some 215 million years ago, reports LiveScience. In separating carbon isotopes from fossilized organic matter, they identified significant and rapid changes to the ecosystem and atmospheric CO2 levels—which were four to six times those of today. Pollen and spores suggested available plants varied in quantity based on the frequent changes, while fossil charcoal showed evidence of wildfires every few dozen years that wreaked havoc on vegetation. The combined factors suggest an environment too unstable for sauropods until about 30 million years later, though small, carnivorous dinosaurs did populate the area.  The conditions would have been something similar to the arid Western United States today, although there would have been trees and smaller plants near streams and rivers and forests during humid times,  study author Jessica Whiteside explains in a press release. Eerily, she writes at the Conversation that  rapid climate swings and extremes of drought and intense heat driven by increasing atmospheric CO2 levels have as much ability to alter the vegetation supporting modern human populations as they did for the large plant-eating dinosaurs in the Triassic.  Whiteside adds we can expect  profound challenges to human sustainability in the future if we experience the high CO2 conditions predicted to develop in the coming 100 to 200 years.

As for those 24 aforementioned studies, all but two showed no benefit.

Unfortunately, after getting off to a good start in Falmouth, Mass., (Tiverton-Little Compton Patch reports his dad dropped him and his $170 bike  on the side of the road ) and losing 60 pounds in those first two weeks, the Indiana man hit a bump in the road, reports Fox 59: He bent the rim of one of his wheels in Tiverton, RI.

During the tense moment, Clinton responded,  You know what? Nobody's ever asked me before,  adding that  I'm happy to address it.  Williams was escorted out before that happened, however. Now Clinton is taking the opportunity to respond—and she has more than a few regrets for ever uttering those  superpredator  remarks.  Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today,  she told Jonathan Capehart, writing for the Washington Post. In the 1996 speech at New Hampshire's Keene State College, where she spoke about the 1994 Violent Crime Control Act, Clinton said,  They are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called 'superpredators.' No conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first we have to bring them to heel.  Capehart writes that the comments referenced  a narrow band of young people,  and he thinks that critics now accusing Clinton of suggesting that most or all black youth fell into that category are being unfair. He also notes that Bernie Sanders voted to pass that crime bill, which was signed into law by Bill Clinton.

That's basically what a federal appeals court told a California woman Thursday when it dismissed her class-action lawsuit alleging Fresh Inc. conned consumers into thinking there was more of its Sugar Lip Treatment in the tube than they could actually access, Courthouse News Service reports. The US Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit rejected Angela Ebner's claim that the company tried to mislead consumers about the quantity of its pricey lip balm, which sells for roughly $24 a tube, per the AP. Ebner had insisted that the way the company packaged and dispensed the lip treatment was in violation of her state's consumer protection laws, Reuters notes. To be more specific, Ebner said that the lip balm tube employs a twist-up mechanism that allows only 75% of the product to dispense beyond the tube opening. But the court noted that no state or federal laws were breached because the package labels accurately indicate just how much balm is in each tube. The court opinion stated, probably not to Ebner's liking, that  the reasonable consumer understands the general mechanics of these dispenser tubes  and that  it is up to the consumer to decide whether it is worth the effort to extract any remaining product with a finger or a small tool.

The latter may face charges as well, because he knew of the imprisonment and did not report it. Police described the locked basement where Sebastiana was detained as  filthy, dark.  Groppo and his wife had been married 40 years, a relationship that disintegrated, according to Groppo, as she descended into mental illness. After an anonymous tip alerted police to Groppo's abuse, he said that  locking her up was the only way he could think of to prevent her from wandering off and getting lost.  Police also arrested Groppo's girlfriend as an accomplice. Sebastiana was examined in a hospital and released to her son.  She appears to be in good physical condition, but to be on the safe side we asked the son to make sure she gets a full checkup and continued psychiatric help,  police said.",

But the key word in that sentence is  might,  notes Philip Elmer-DeWitt of Fortune. It's still not chump change, but all Apple actually gave Cook last year was a $900,017 salary and a $14,700 contribution to his 401(K). The hundreds of millions more come from restricted stock units he was given upon promotion. Half of those shares don't vest until 2016, and the other half don't until 2021, so if Cook flames out at Apple, his 2011 payday could look pretty modest indeed. But the SEC requires companies to report share grants as compensation in the year they're given, so lots of reporters are referring to $378 million as Cook's  total compensation.  But if Cook really makes that much,  you could argue that he was worth it,  Elmer-DeWitt writes.",

A new study out of Australia finds that women are more likely to find a man desirable if he's already had one or two partners, the country's ABC News reports.  There appears to be a significant desirability advantage for men who have been previously selected as a romantic partner,  say the authors—amusingly, their study, published in Human Nature, is titled  I Want What She's Having.  The phenomenon is known as  mate copying,  and researchers already knew animals practiced it, but wanted to see if it played a role in human mate selection.  A man seeking a mate can get a lot of the information he needs just by observing his potential mate, but ... females are not as superficial as males,  the lead author explains. They need to assess things like whether their partner will be a good parent or whether he'll stay committed; that's likely why they look for a male who's already been  road-tested  by other females and is thus more likely to have these desirable traits. But don't take it too far, guys: The researchers asked 123 women to rate the desirability of men using photos that noted the number of relationships they've racked up in four years, and  when you go to five, the guy becomes really undesirable.  (More on the desirability front: A recent study found that the idea of men having  trophy wives  is largely a myth.)",

Per the Post, hot dog-eating champ Takeru Kobayashi joined four other competitive eaters at a Chicago restaurant last night to break the spell, and their alchemy involved chowing down on a cooked 40-pound goat in a chowdown one observer said transpired in  about twelve minutes,  adding,  That was … disgusting.  And if the Cubs don't make the playoffs? As the Post puts it, the goat gorging will just have been  much ado about mutton.  If they win the World Series, however, you could have a shot at an $85,000 DeLorean. (Read all about the curse here.)",

It has gone over the edge,  Lee Palmer told dispatchers.  He's trying to attack us—he's very hostile. He's at our door; he's charging us.  The 4-year-old male cat, named Lux, had first scratched owner Teresa Barker's 7-month-old son on the forehead after the baby pulled the animal's tail. Barker's boyfriend Palmer then kicked the cat away from the baby, setting the animal off, KATU reports. As Lux charged, the couple locked themselves, the baby, and their dog in a bedroom and called police, as the cat could be heard yowling in the background. Officers showed up with a dog snare and chased the cat into the kitchen; it jumped on top of the fridge, but the cops managed to force it into a carrier. No one was injured, and no word yet on what will become of the cat—who, Palmer said on the 911 call,  has a history of violence.  Palmer says the family is  debating what to do.  Adds Barker,  It's only funny when it's not happening to you. ... It was very frightening.",

Travis Hittson, 45—convicted in the April 1992 killing of Conway Utterbeck—was declared dead at 8:14pm after receiving an injection of barbiturate pentobarbital at the state prison in Jackson. When asked if he wanted to make a final statement, Hittson said,  No, sir. I'm alright.  Hittson blinked repeatedly for several minutes and then appeared to take several deep breaths before becoming still about four minutes after the warden left the execution chamber. The AP recounts the crime: Hittson's lawyers had said he was mistreated as a child and constantly craved the approval of others. That, they said, combined with alcoholism and relatively low intelligence, made it easy for his direct supervisor in the Navy, Edward Vollmer, to manipulate him into killing Utterbeck while the three were visiting Vollmer's parents' home in central Georgia. Hittson told investigators he and Vollmer went out drinking one night and Vollmer said Utterbeck planned to kill them both and that they needed to  get him  first. Upon returning to the house, Hittson shot Utterbeck in the head, according to court filings. They buried Utterbeck's torso in Georgia and the rest of the remains in Pensacola, Florida, where they were stationed.

The $2,000 initiative proved unsuccessful and a recent lack of funding has meant the search for alien communication has fallen by the wayside. Now, in the biggest breakthrough for the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence since, Russian billionaire Yuri Milner has announced $100 million in funding over a decade for SETI researchers to scan the 1,000 closest stars for alien life as part of a new project, Breakthrough Listen.  We have a responsibility to not stop searching,  Milner, the man behind the Breakthrough Prize, tells the New York Times.  We should be listening.  The money will go toward new receiving equipment, hiring students and astronomers, and securing time on the largest radio telescopes in West Virginia, San Jose, Calif., and Australia, reports Nature. Scientists have heard  fast radio bursts  in the past, in a typical  24-36 hours on a telescope per year, but now we'll have thousands of hours per year on the best instruments,  a SETI scientist says.  It's difficult to overstate how big this is. It's a revolution.  The Breakthrough Listen team adds the money will allow scientists to see radar and even tiny lasers from stars up to four light-years away.  It's quite likely that we won't find anything,  Milner notes.  But in 10 years' time, there will be even more advances and we can work out the best strategy for the next 10 years of the project, and then maybe the next 10 after that.  The observations are expected to begin next year, reports Scientific American, and the data will be made available to the public. Milner is also planning a Breakthrough Message competition. People will be able to submit a digital message that could be broadcast into space. The winner will receive a $1 million prize. (One scientists suspects aliens are huge.)",

The author of the strike is clearly ... either the government or Russia,  says Mego Terzian, president of Doctors Without Borders in France, of the main Marat Numan attack.

The intruders sneaked past security posts, rammed gates, climbed fences, and, in one case in Florida, dug under a fence. At least 44 intruders made it as far as runways or gate areas, according to the AP, which notes that the total is probably an undercount: Two airports didn't provide full information, and Boston's Logan Airport refused to provide any at all for security reasons. Airport officials say the fact that intruders were caught shows that security systems generally work well, although for security reasons, not many airports would say how long it took to catch them.

It's another thing entirely to win a game you've never played before. Christian Pham of St. Paul, Minn., did exactly that Thursday, rising to the top of 219 players, including a few poker icons. By accident. The 40-year-old professional poker player says he intended to play no-limit Texas Hold 'em but inadvertently signed up for a different game happening the same day: so-called no-limit deuce-to-seven draw lowball. The cost? A $1,500 buy-in.  It's a totally different game. Different mindset. Different strategies,  says a dealer. Essentially, the goal is to have the lowest poker hand, no straights or flushes, and if a player ends up with a pair, it's better if it's a pair of twos. Players can also draw cards. Pham says he didn't realize his mistake until he was dealt five cards instead of the usual two. He panicked, then observed, leaning on helpful players who advised him what beat what.  At first you suspect an act, but if it was, it was very good,  says Chris Mecklin, who was sitting next to Pham when the newbie realized he had made a mistake. He didn't know it would be a fortuitous one. Pham, who moved to the US from Vietnam 15 years ago, says the guidance from his fellow players at the table helped, and he studied up the night in between the two-day contest.

The finding is the earliest such proof of cheese-making, and it would have been a huge innovation in the late Neolothic period, explains the LA Times. For one thing, most adults were lactose-intolerant at the time, and turning milk into cheese would make it easier to digest and thus be an important source of food. (It probably had the consistency of modern cottage cheese.) The discovery also may have helped dairy farming take hold. Ars Technica has more on how the University of Bristol researchers concluded that the pots were used to process milk.",

Two of the men, known only as Arjun and Lakki, were arrested in the tourist town, while Som Bahadur Tamang was arrested some 70 miles south, the Wall Street Journal reports. The three, described as being in their early 20s, haven't yet been formally charged.  Circumstantial evidence and forensic evidence links all three men to the scene of the crime,  says a police superintendent. Authorities are testing forensic evidence from a small truck they seized. The truck has a broken windshield and torn seats which are reportedly evidence in the case; police also used mobile phone records to track down those arrested. According to police, the truck's owner said he employed Arjun, and the other two men are thought to be Arjun's friends. Rape cases in India have hurt the country's tourist trade lately, the Journal notes, with travel agencies seeing a 25% drop in the first three months of 2013 compared to the year before.

When she started throwing up blood and her skin started turning blue, Brianna's parents called an ambulance and she was rushed to the hospital and into surgery. But doctors couldn't stop the internal bleeding she was experiencing. The culprit? Though an official cause of death is still pending an autopsy, an X-ray showed Brianna had swallowed a button battery. Vice says the family was told the toddler had probably ingested the battery sometime within six days of her death, and doctors  believed the battery (acid) ate through to her carotid artery by way of her esophagus.  Just days before Brianna's death, a leading pediatric surgeon in the UK warned of the dangers of button batteries—small, shiny lithium batteries referred to as  buttons  because of their size and shape.

We shared the news with friends and even posted a picture on social media,  he tells People. Never did he imagine that their newborn would live just six short days. Weeks after his daughter's death on June 9, Rogers of the Randy Rogers Band is speaking about the heartbreak he and his wife Chelsea felt when Rumer wouldn't eat or open her eyes. Doctors told the couple that it was normal for a baby act as though she was still in the womb, and she was put on a feeding tube. But suddenly, she stopped breathing and had to be put on a ventilator. Test after test provided no answers, he says.  It was a six-day process. It was heart-wrenching and grueling not knowing what was wrong.  Doctors soon came back with awful news. Rumer had an incurable genetic disorder affecting the brain, known as nonketotic hyperglycinemia, which is found in about 1 in 66,000 babies annually in the US and, according to NKH Network, affects a child's ability to break down the amino acid glycine.  Chelsea and I always thought that we were two peas in a pod,  says Rogers.  Turns out literally we are, genetically; we have the same exact recessed gene. The odds are astronomical.  The couple, who have two other daughters, Isabel, 5, and River, 21 months, say they can still have more children, but will now use in-vitro fertilization and genetic testing to ensure  no one else in our family will have to have that happen to them,  Rogers says. In the meantime, Rogers has created a fund to provide nesting suites for families of babies at Seton Medical Center Austin, like the one the couple used.  This is something every hospital in the country should have,  he says. On Twitter, he thanks People  for giving our family the opportunity to tell our story and answer so many questions.

The Verge reports scientists from Washington University in St. Louis have created a new map of the human brain that includes 97 areas never before identified. They published their findings Wednesday in Nature. A professor at Yale calls the new map—which Wired says  sort of looks like a page from an adult coloring book —a  huge leap in neuroscience.  The map gives new detail to the cerebral cortex, the outer layer of the brain responsible for motion, senses, emotions, and problem solving. Scientists hope it will help clarify how different parts of the brain impact human behavior, Popular Science reports. For example, researchers could use the map to find what areas are different between the brains of people with and without learning disabilities. Scientists created the new map by combining three different imaging techniques used on the brains of 210 young adults.  No one's done this across the whole human brain,  the study's author, Matt Glasser, tells Wired. The result is a map of 180 cortical areas in each of the brain's hemispheres—more than half of them completely new. In fact, they're not even sure what some of them do. For example, one cortical area is activated by relaxing but deactivated by math problems for some reason. While the new map doubles the amount of mapped areas in the brain, the scientists behind it think further research will reveal even more.

The bombing, claimed by ISIS, was the deadliest terror attack in Iraq in a year and one of the worst single bombings in more than a decade of war and insurgency, the AP reports. It underscored the militants' ability to strike the Iraqi capital despite a string of battlefield losses elsewhere in the country and fueled public anger toward the political leadership. The suicide bomber blew up his explosives-laden vehicle in Baghdad's mostly Shiite Karada district, a favorite avenue for shoppers—especially during the holy month of Ramadan, with the streets and sidewalks filled with young people and families after they had broken their daylight fast. Police and health officials said Monday the toll stood at 142, with 185 wounded, but it is likely to increase even further as rescuers are still looking for missing people. Hours after the bombing, al-Abadi visited the attack site, but a furious mob surrounded his convoy, yelling expletives, hurling rocks and shoes at the prime minister's cars, and calling him a  thief.  In a statement issued later Sunday, al-Abadi ordered that a scandal-ridden bomb detection device be pulled from service. He also demanded increased aerial scanning, a step-up in intelligence efforts, and the division of responsibility among various security units.",

His legs were spread and his hair was standing, and he was growling, and baring his teeth,  Barnaby says. The wolf started pacing in front of her, herding her and Joey away from her truck and the highway.  It took me a while to realize that he knew what he was doing. He was trying to wear me down.  The wolf pursued Barnaby for 12 hours.  He was dogged. He was just determined.  Then, around 4:30am, Barnaby heard a mother bear and cub calling to each other from a distance.  I realized that there was a chance that the mother bear would tackle the wolf if she felt that the wolf was a threat.  Barnaby headed toward the cub and before long heard crashing in the forest behind her.

The initiative will focus on  personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities,  building on previous investments in  education, science, health, Internet access, and inclusion,  Zuckerberg explained. He also addressed concerns that the donation—equivalent to the GDP of Serbia, or around $38 for every Facebook user—could be some kind of tax dodge, explaining that  we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively  and that if he wanted to avoid tax, it would have been far more effective to set up a traditional charity, the Verge reports.

Monday's announcement comes days after Japan submitted its final plan to the International Whaling Commission after the commission's scientific committee said earlier this year it wasn't convinced that whales needed to be killed for research on whale stock management and conservation. Japan says lethal sampling is indispensable to obtain data on the maturing ages of whales. The IWC imposed a commercial ban on whaling in 1986, but Japan has continued to kill whales under a research exemption. This will be the first expedition since the International Court of Justice ruled last year that they weren't truly scientific, forcing Tokyo to revise its Antarctic whaling plans. Last year, Japan did go to the Antarctic, but didn't kill any whales. Japan's actual catch has fallen in recent years in part because of declining domestic demand for whale meat; protests by anti-whaling group Sea Shepherd have also contributed. Tokyo plans to catch up to 333 minke whales each year over the next 12 years, about one-third of what it used to, the Fisheries Agency and the Foreign Ministry said Monday. The plan will be evaluated after six years. Fifteen environmental and animal rights groups say in a statement that Tokyo should stop using taxpayer money to keep the debt-ridden whaling operation alive.  We strongly demand that the government not start any new research whaling programs, and instead take on new measures that contribute to ocean conservation,  they say. Australia, which brought the ICJ case against Japan, said it might send a boat to shadow the Japanese fleet.",

Now, thanks to a TNT TV show that investigates unsolved murders, Marisol's former boyfriend, Cecilio Cruz, has been charged with second-degree murder and manslaughter in her death. Police had suspected Cruz, now 34, almost from the start—Marisol discovered she was pregnant with his child the day after they broke up, they reportedly were fighting about the pregnancy and other things the night of her murder, and Cruz moved out of the area a week after she was killed. But no DNA or weapon was ever found, and the investigation stalled—until Cottonwood officer Tod Moore reopened the case six years ago. He eventually contacted the show Cold Justice, which flew an investigative team out in October, helping police piece together enough evidence to indict Cruz.  Most of the evidence we've always had.

After a technician determined there was a problem with the modem Dorff used to access the AOL service, the elderly man says he was told AT&T would not adjust the massive bill, according to Lazarus, who says the company waived the charges after he stepped in. A spokesman says Dorff's modem had somehow started calling a long-distance number when it accessed AOL, racking up hefty charges for every minute he was online. Whatever the issue was, Lazarus thinks AT&T could have done a lot better.  I don't care if Dorff was making daily calls to the International Space Station,  he writes.  The simple fact is that AT&T allowed a customer's bill to become so over the top as to be laughable,  then dug in its heels when the customer—who lives off Social Security checks—tried to deal with it. He adds that he was surprised to discover that Dorff is one of 2.2 million people still using AOL dial-up service.

The scientists say that the zircon crystals from 4.1 billion years ago contain a telltale carbon deposit that appears to have come from something organic, Reuters reports. That's getting closer to the origin of the planet itself, roughly 4.5 billion years ago. Before now, the earliest hint of life was found in rocks 3.8 billion years old. There's no chance the carbon deposit could be any younger than the zircon because the crystal is crack-free and undisturbed, the researchers write in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The zircon crystals were formed during a geological era known as the Hadean, after Hades, because conditions were thought to be so hellish that no life could have existed, the New Scientist notes. The UCLA and Stanford researchers now dispute that, saying life on Earth may have formed  almost instantaneously —and restarted quickly if it were wiped out at some point.  The early Earth certainly wasn't a hellish, dry, boiling planet; we see absolutely no evidence for that,  study co-author Mark Harrison says in a UCLA press release.

A number of party guests performed CPR on the girl before she was transported to the hospital, where a large marshmallow was found lodged in her throat. Azriel died without ever regaining consciousness. She had hit her head when she passed out, severely injuring her head, WPXI reports. Estabrooks blames the party's hosts for her daughter's death, claiming they were negligent in not keeping an eye on Azriel.  They didn’t find her in time,  she tells WCVB.  Someone didn't realize she was choking on a marshmallow. She was already on the floor passed out by the time anyone found her.  Doctors believe oxygen had already been cut off to Azriel's brain before any aid was given. Estabrooks told NBC 10 News on Wednesday that the hosts of the party never called to check on Azriel while she was in the hospital. Azriel's family has set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for her funeral.  The family is grieving the loss of their beautiful little girl,  the page states.  She will always be with them in their hearts and watching over them and especially her younger brother and sister.

William Flynn was 16-year-old  Billy  in 1990 when he and three teenage friends carried out what prosecutors said was Pamela Smart's plot to murder Gregg Smart in New Hampshire. Flynn pleaded guilty to second-degree murder and was sentenced to 28 years to life in prison, minus time served before trial. The trial was a media circus and one of the first high-profile cases about a sexual affair between an instructor and student. It inspired the Joyce Maynard novel To Die For, which in turn was made into a movie starring Nicole Kidman. The board granted Flynn parole on his first attempt today, his 41st birthday. He has been in a Maine prison and participated in the hearing by telephone, telling the board that he'd always be haunted by the killing. Pamela Smart, who was 22 when her husband was killed, was convicted of being an accomplice to first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without the chance of parole. Smart was one of Flynn's instructors in a self-awareness program when she first seduced him when he was 15; Flynn testified that she threatened to break up with him if he didn't kill her husband. On May 1, 1990, Flynn and 17-year-old Patrick Randall entered the Smarts' Derry condominium and forced Gregory Smart to his knees in the foyer. As Randall held a knife to the man's throat, Flynn fired a hollow-point bullet into his head. Randall got 28 years to life; he comes up for parole in April. Two other teenagers served prison sentences and have been released.",

The organization announced Tuesday that the American hairless terrier and the sloughi have joined 187 other recognized breeds. The newcomers can now compete in most AKC shows and competitions, though not at the prominent Westminster Kennel Club show until next year. Many American hairless terriers are, as advertised, bare-skinned, though others have short coats but carry the hairless gene. Their rise began when a hairless puppy emerged in a litter of rat terriers in the 1970s, wowing a Louisiana couple and leading to deliberate breeding of the hairless dogs, according to the American Hairless Terrier Club of America.  They're terrier-smart  but somewhat calmer than some other terrier breeds, says a club secretary.  They're very easy to live with because they're very trainable.  The sloughi—pronounced SLOO-ghee—also called the Arabian greyhound, was developed to hunt game as big as gazelles. The lean, leggy dogs have some similarities to Salukis, another hound breed from North Africa. Sloughis are known for speed, endurance, grace, and rather reserved demeanors.",

On the night of Nov. 9, 1989, thousands of East Berliners streamed through the once-closed border crossings after communist authorities caved to mounting pressure.  It was about reclaiming freedom, about being citizens, not subjects,  Merkel said at the main memorial site for the Wall on Bernauer Strasse.  The fall of the Wall has shown us that dreams can come true,  said Merkel, who grew up in East Germany.  Nothing has to stay the way it is, however big the hurdles are.  Activists staged a small demonstration during the memorial event, holding up a banner with the words  No wall around Europe  to protest the treatment of refugees trying to reach the continent. A million people were expected to attend today's festivities in Berlin, which included an open-air party at the city's Brandenburg Gate and the release of hundreds of helium-filled balloon strung along a 9-mile stretch of the former border. Merkel noted that Nov. 9 is also the day when, in 1938, Nazi paramilitaries launched a pogrom against the country's Jewish population in what became known as Reichskristallnacht—the  Night of Broken Glass.   That was the opening note for the murder of millions,  said Merkel, adding that on Nov. 9 each year  I feel not just joy, but the responsibility that German history burdens us with.",

Debris found at the surface indicates that at least part of the hybrid remotely operated vehicle likely imploded under pressure as great as 16,000 pounds per square inch.

The debris spotted by the ship will be analyzed to verify its source and to attempt to find clues in the Nereus' demise. Among the standout details of the vehicle, which was built in 2008: It is one of just four submersibles to ever reach the deepest part of the ocean in the Mariana Trench; it has collected specimens of animals previously unknown to science; and it explored the world's deepest known hydrothermal vents along the Caribbean's Cayman Rise.

At age 16, Ivins Rosier confessed to breaking into the home of Florida Highway Patrol Trooper Robert Boody in West Palm Beach and shooting the 5-year-old German Shepherd, the newspaper noted in May. Rosier's attorney argued that a detective  hustled  the boy during interrogation by equating the dog's death to the  murder of a law enforcement officer  (which wasn't legally true). Rosier's attorney also wanted his client sentenced as a juvenile with a maximum sentence of 6 years, CBS 12 reports.  I believe this to be sadistic to do this to a child,  said Rosier's attorney, who plans to appeal. He conceded that Rosier's crimes were serious,  but when you look at the range of punishments available, that's why they call it juvenile.  Ultimately, Rosier's sentence resulted from convictions on three felony counts: cruelty to animals with a firearm, burglary of a dwelling with a firearm, and shooting into a building.  A gun in a 16-year-old's hand can do equally the damage as a gun in an adult's hand,  said the prosecuting attorney.  He's not a child.

Funny how that notion took hold—that we use a tenth of our brain at any given time—because there's no actual evidence for it, the Conversation reports. The idea may date back to psychologist William James, who wrote in 1907 that we use  only a small part of our possible mental and physical resources,  and a foreword to Dale Carnegie's How to Win Friends and Influence People that loosely quoted James as saying that  the average person develops only 10% of his latent mental ability.  Now, products exist to  unlock the other 90%  and a new thriller, Lucy, shows Scarlett Johansson taking drugs that enable her to use all 100% of her brain. But, as the Atlantic reports, scientists point out that the brain is an organ packed with living neurons that are always up to something. Brain scans that show only a small active portion of gray matter  lighting up  may confuse people, one neuroscience professor points out, because they show only the brain's major activities, not all of them. Yet  those kinds of ideas self-perpetuate,  he says. One possible basis for the 10% notion: The brain has almost 100 billion neurons, which are outnumbered roughly 10:1 by  glial  cells that keep the brain working.  In other words,  the Conversation notes,  neurons are only 10% of our entire brain.  (See how lack of sleep can fry brain cells.)",

The paper shows that global wealth owned by the richest 1% jumped from 44% in 2009 to 48% in 2014, putting this elite group on track to cross the 50% mark by next year, the BBC reports. Those in the top group had an average wealth of $2.7 million per adult last year (the BBC notes that to qualify as part of that group, one needs to be worth about $750,000). Meanwhile, the poorest 80% of the world owned just 5.5% of the world's riches and claimed an average wealth of $3,851 per adult. Oxfam's research backs up a similar 2014 report from Credit Suisse, as per the BBC.  The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering,  Oxfam Executive Director Winnie Byanyima says in a statement.  Do we really want to live in a world where the [1%] own more than the rest of us combined?  Byanyima, who's co-chairing the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos this week, will underscore these points by presenting a seven-point plan for governments to narrow the gap in their own countries. Included in Oxfam's plan are calls to get tougher on corporate tax evasion, invest in free public health care and education, and lobby for equal-pay laws to help women get ahead in the workplace. The charity is hoping its report  shines a light  on how the richest of the rich get their money (a good chunk of it's inherited) and how they push for rules regarding money to benefit them.

Mexico's National Council for Culture for the Arts confirmed the death of Mexico's most celebrated novelist. The cause was not immediately known. His generation of writers, including Colombia's Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Peru's Mario Vargas Llosa, drew global readership and attention to Latin American culture during a period when strongmen ruled much of the region. The prolific Fuentes wrote his first novel, Where the Air is Clear, at age 29, laying the foundation for a boom in Spanish contemporary literature during the 1960s and 1970s. The Death of Artemio Cruz, a novel about a post-revolutionary Mexico that failed to keep its promise of narrowing social gaps, brought Fuentes international notoriety. The elegant, mustachioed author's other contemporary classics included Aura, Terra Nostra, and The Good Conscience. Many American readers know him for The Old Gringo, a novel about San Francisco journalist Ambrose Bierce, who disappeared at the height of the 1910-1920 Mexican Revolution. That book was later made into a film starring Gregory Peck and Jane Fonda.",

Graves initially  refused to leave  the area but was eventually convinced after he was promised he could return after getting medical treatment. As he rode with Graves to the hospital, Wellons says that Graves relayed  the horror that he experienced  trying to save Lane and that  another gator attacked him as he fought for his son.  Assistant Chief Stan Paynter reportedly forwarded this correspondence to Orange County officials so they'd know about the possibility of a second gator. Five alligators were killed shortly after the incident. The boy's body was discovered intact about 15 yards from shore, 6 feet underwater.

Never fear: There's apparently a pretty good chance one or more of your adult children will move back in with you at some point. A Pew Research Center analysis of US Census Bureau data finds that last year, 36.4% of women from age 18 to age 34 lived with their parents or relatives. That's the highest number since at least 1940, when 36.2% such women lived with family, the AP reports. (Less newsworthy is the fact that 42.8% of young men lived with parents or relatives last year—historically, more young men have lived with family than young women, the AP explains, and 42.8% is well below the 47.5% of young men who lived with family in 1940. The percentage of young people living with family fell after the 1940s in part because marriage rates increased and the workforce expanded; more women also joined the workforce. At the time, the median age of marriage for women was 21.5. Nowadays, it's 27, which is part of the reason more adult women are living with their parents: They're half as likely to be married as women of the same age were in 1940, but are more likely to have a college education, a Pew senior economist explains. There's also the fact that they're facing student debt and a higher cost of living these days. As for men, their median age of marriage was 24.3 in 1940 and is 29.3 now. Young adults of both sexes started increasingly moving back home after 2000 thanks to the uncertainty of the job market, but the job market is better now than it was in 2010 ... and yet, more adults are living with their parents now than that year.",

What in the world do grilled cheese sandwiches—$5 grilled cheese sandwiches, Gawker notes skeptically—have to do with the digital world? Well, there's an app, of course. Kaplan's company, The Melt, will allow users to order sandwiches via a mobile site. Customers will then receive a QR code they can redeem at any Melt restaurant (Kaplan has enough money to open 20) for a freshly-made meal. Though Gawker's Ryan Tate's take on the whole thing is a bit snarky ( Despite what anyone tells you, we're not in a tech bubble! ), VentureBeat's Anthony Ha notes that  it sounds like Kaplan is really trying to invent a new model for the restaurant business, one that uses mobile technology for an experience that’s fast and flexible without sacrificing quality.",

The unidentified Marines from an elite Raiders unit were advising Iraqi soldiers in the Qara Chockh Mountains, about 37 miles south of Erbil, when they were killed by enemy forces, officials said Monday, per NBC News and Military.com, adding four additional US troops were injured. A coalition spokesman said the recovery of the dead and wounded took some six hours, per Military.com. Officials estimated that some 15 to 19 ISIS fighters had been killed. The Iraqi military said at least 25 ISIS fighters were killed and nine tunnels and a training camp were destroyed, per the Washington Post. These are the first US combat deaths since a Marine Raider, Gunnery Sgt. Scott Koppenhafer, was killed during a mission to track an ISIS suspect in Iraq's Nineveh province in August, though two US personnel were killed in a joint operation between US and Afghan forces last month, per NBC.  The Makhmur Mountains are historically known to be an ISIS safe haven. However, there is no safe place for ISIS to hide,  officials said, per Military.com.  The Coalition, alongside our partner forces, will continue to hunt the remnants of the illegitimate caliphate in order to disrupt any effort to resurge.

Eric Schneiderman sent cease-and-desist letters to Walmart, GNC, Target, and Walgreen, ordering they remove the suspect store-brand supplements—including echinacea, ginkgo biloba, ginseng, garlic, St. John's wort, and saw palmetto—from NY shelves after DNA testing found plants listed on labels were either in short supply, swapped out for cheap (and possibly allergy-inducing) substitutes such as powdered rice or wheat, or not present at all.  Mislabeling, contamination, and false advertising are illegal,  Schneiderman said, per the New York Times.  They also pose unacceptable risks to New York families—especially those with allergies to hidden ingredients.  Almost 80% of supplements tested at the retailers didn't contain any of the herbs they claimed; Walmart fared the worst, with only 4% of its tested products adhering to label claims, the Guardian notes. The findings have reinvigorated the debate about whether herbal supplements—which don't have to be FDA-approved like drugs before going to market—should be subject to stricter governmental oversight. Advocates for such change, however, have to fight the supplement industry and powerful advocates such as Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch, who sponsored the 1994 FDA law exempting herb supplements, the Times notes. A Harvard professor and supplement safety expert tells the Times that  if this data is accurate, then it is an unbelievably devastating indictment of the industry.",

The simple, speedy theft is the biggest jewelry heist in years. Police had previously said yesterday's theft at the Carlton Intercontinental Hotel netted $53 million worth of treasure—even at that level a major haul. Philippe Vique, an assistant prosecutor, said the Dubai-based organizer of the diamond show had since raised the value based on a more complete inventory. Vique described a canny, but quick and logistically simple, break-in. The suspect somehow got in through the hotel's locked French doors, which open onto Cannes' famed Croisette promenade, then held up the participants of the show with a handgun and fled on foot. The hold-up itself took about a minute, all with three private security guards, two vendors, and a manager of the sale-exhibit on hand.  He took a bag containing a briefcase and a small box, and then fled by another French door on the inside,  Vique said.  He left on foot ... it was very fast.

But not just any men—nearly a year of authentication proved that the photo shows Billy the Kid and members of his gang of outlaws, The Regulators, and now the picture (which, the Sacramento Bee notes, actually cost Guijarro only 88 cents) is going to auction and could sell for $5 million, USA Today reports.  When we first saw the photograph, we were understandably skeptical—an original Billy the Kid photo is the Holy Grail of Western Americana,  says the senior numismatist at Kagin's, the firm of experts that authenticated the tintype and will negotiate its sale. There's only one other known photo of Billy the Kid, taken in 1880, and that 2-by-3-inch tintype sold for $2.3 million in 2010. The process of authenticating the newly discovered picture of Billy (real name William Henry McCarty Jr. , though he also used the alias William H. Bonney) will be explored on a National Geographic special Sunday. It all started after Guijarro enlarged the image he'd bought and thought he recognized Billy the Kid and his best friends, Tom O'Folliard and Charlie Bowdre. Sallie Chisum is in the picture, too, ABC30 reports, and Fox News notes that research of her writings revealed the photo was taken after Bowdre's wedding.  We had to be certain that we could answer and verify where, when, how, and why this photograph was taken,  the numismatist says. Experts in digital facial recognition, antique photography, geographic positioning, and even vintage croquet sets were brought in and will be featured on the documentary.  It's the holy grail of not just Western photography. It's the holy grail of photography,  the executive director of the documentary tells the San Francisco Chronicle.",

The number of applications forced the plant to stop accepting applications May 18, weeks before the June 2 due date.

A website sorts through the applications; between 6,000 and 7,000 will be evaluated in person.

And at least one archeologist believes he knows what it holds.  Clearly it does look from the radar evidence as if the tomb continues, as I have predicted,  Nicholas Reeves said at a news conference on Saturday.  I think it is Nefertiti, and all the evidence points in that direction.  The tomb of Queen Nefertiti has never definitively been found, and Reeves believes King Tut was actually buried in her tomb because his wasn't ready, with her being shunted off to a side room, according to the BBC. He came up with his theory while analyzing detailed scans of King Tut's tomb used to create a replica for tourists. He claims those scans revealed two doorways that were covered up. Infrared scans made earlier this month seemed to support Reeves' theory, showing differing heat patterns along the walls of the tomb, AFP reports. According to the BBC, Egypt's Antiquities ministry did further scans to test the theory over the past few weeks, leading to Saturday's  90%  estimate. The scans are being sent to Japan for further analysis. And while experts are now fairly convinced Reeves was right about the hidden chamber, the question of who—if anyone—is inside is still being debated. The AFP reports the next step for researchers is to figure out how to get through the hidden doorways without damaging King Tut's tomb.

Egypt's housing minister said the Capital Cairo project is meant to ease congestion and overpopulation in the current capital over the next four decades, during which time Cairo will reportedly double in size. The initial phase will include 150 square miles (about the size of Denver, the Atlantic notes) of development in Cairo's outskirts, adding a new governmental center, universities, hospitals, and an international airport. Expansion would eventually reach 270 square miles and link up with the Suez Canal area, the AP notes.

Khaled Fahmy's take in the Cairo Observer, however, isn't quite so rosy. Announcing that  we, Cairenes and Egyptians, were not informed, let alone consulted about this move,  Fahmy goes on to say how  unsuitable  it is to model the new city after Dubai (Egypt hired a Dubai-based private investor group to build the city, per the Atlantic).

On June 4, 1629, the Dutch East India ship the Batavia was downed by a reef on its maiden voyage. Most of the roughly 340 people aboard managed to reach nearby Beacon Island, off Western Australia, with the ship's captain setting off in search of help in a longboat. What happened in July of that year was gruesome: The West Australian reports that more than 120 people, among them women and children, were massacred by a group of mutineers led by undermerchant Jeronimus Cornelisz: Some were felled by musket fire or swords, others poisoned or drowned. Upon the captain's return, Cornelisz and many of his men were executed, reports the BBC. The Batavia's wreck was found in 1963, and a mass grave on the island was uncovered in 1999. Australia's ABC reports that the final day of searching the island during a 2013 expedition surfaced a tooth. Upon returning, archaeologists searched the area where the tooth was uncovered and have now found the island's 11th skeleton—with an archaeologist explaining it's the first to have been found using archaeology, while the others found to date were uncovered  by accident.  Two musket balls were recovered near the remains, which are believed to be that of a youth. Jeremy Green, the WA Museum's head of maritime archaeology, says it doesn't appear the remains and the tooth are linked, however, indicating there may be another grave nearby. He frames the importance of uncovering more:  This was the first time that Europeans lived in Australia—albeit it wasn't in the mainland but it was here—so it's the oldest known European habitation in Australia.  (The tragic story behind three partial skeletons was recently revealed, more than 160 years later.)",

When it was finally over, 146 workers, mostly young women, were dead. A firestorm of controversy followed as investigations revealed the company had almost no safety precautions.

What was ailing the nonagenarian turned out to be more horrifying than her family could have imagined, and now a judge has ordered the home to pay them $250,000 for wrongful death and for violating the Illinois Nursing Home Care Act, the Daily Herald reports. After a maggot was spotted moving in McCann's ear on Sept. 16, 2012, by a nursing home worker, she was whisked to a local hospital. There, her daughter watched as  the larvae of flies crawled out of her mother's left ear  as 57 maggots were removed, Chicago Tribune originally reported; it's thought that a fly landed in her ear and laid the eggs. McCann had been diagnosed with wax buildup a little over a week before the maggots were discovered and was prescribed eardrops, CBS News noted; Lutheran says she had received drops the night before her hospital visit.  How can you put drops of medicine in an ear that has 57 maggots?  the family's lawyer asked CBS in a November 2012 interview. After the maggots were taken out, the Herald notes, McCann lost her appetite, started humming, and died a few months later at another nursing home her family had moved her to.  The maggot infestation in her left ear created this geriatric cascade that led to her death,  their attorney notes to the Herald. The nursing home's administrator told the Tribune in 2012 what happened to McCann was simply  a freak occurrence that has nothing to do with the care she was provided.  (An Indian man reportedly had 50 maggots taken out of his nose and sinuses.)",

A budding lawyer, Lincoln won a case before the Illinois Supreme Court in 1841 that released Nance Legins-Costley from indentured servitude, which historians say amounted to slavery for a black woman. Legins-Costley walked away with her 10-month-old son, William Henry Costley, and lived to a ripe old age in her central Illinois hometown of Pekin. But what became of the first black male slave freed by Lincoln? An amateur historian named Carl Adams spent years investigating the story and published a book about Legins-Costley last year, Nance: Trials of the First Slave Freed by Abraham Lincoln—A True Story of Nance Legins-Costley. The editor of a history journal says Nance tells  the only story of Lincoln that is really new,  according to a site dedicated to the book. Costley apparently enlisted in a colored-troops regiment from Illinois in 1864, was wounded in the war, and found himself dispatched in Galveston, Texas. A few years later, an all-white jury found him not guilty in the shooting death of a man considered disreputable; Costley said he was protecting a woman when he pulled the trigger. Eventually, Costley moved to Minnesota, became an invalid, and lived in a psychiatric hospital in Rochester. There, Adams says, lies a grave that matches a number from hospital records as Costley's. It also recently received a  Costley  headstone.  I think it is so likely that it's nearly a sure thing,  says a Lincoln expert.

It's the latest effort by geologists to pinpoint exactly when our current historical era began. We're still officially in the Holocene Epoch, reports the BBC, which started nearly 12,000 years ago at the end of the last Ice Age, but the Anthropocene has been proposed as a new era humans set in motion far more recently. Some say this era began as recently as 1964, the point at which the first nuclear tests were banned. Others date it back a century further to the Industrial Revolution. But in the journal Nature, a new proposal suggests that 1610 is the precise start date thanks to the major global impact of the European population on the Americas—from farming and trade to the spread of disease that resulted in the deaths of more than 50 million people, many of whom were farmers. When that farmland returned to its original vegetation, that growth  removed enough carbon from the atmosphere to see a pronounced dip in the global atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration that can be seen in ice core records,  one scientist said. The Anthropocene Working Group is weighing the evidence and says it will suggest its preferred Anthropocene start date sometime next year. (Scientists have been debating this start date for years.)",

Craig Venter, the geneticist who created synthetic life, is pairing up with stem cell leader Dr. Robert Hariri and Dr. Peter Diamandis, founder of the X Prize Foundation; their Human Longevity Inc. has set its initial sights on cancer, but also intends to initially focus on the likes of diabetes, dementia, heart disease, and liver disease in an effort to keep adults healthy as they get older—for as long as possible.  Our goal is to make 100 years old the new 60,  says Diamandis, according to Businessweek. Adds Venter, according to the New York Times,  Your age is your No. 1 risk factor for almost every disease, but it’s not a disease itself.  At the root of the new venture will be what Venter touts as the world's biggest human DNA sequencing operation; the group has already bought two uber-high-tech HiSeq X Ten gene sequencing systems from Illumina, which has provided a healthy share of Human Longevity's $70 million in funding. The systems will allow the group to sequence 40,000 human genomes a year, from the young and healthy to the old and ill, Reuters reports. Ultimately, the company hopes to sequence 100,000 human genomes per year. Combined with information on each person (medical records, genetic data from their microbes, the chemicals in their bloodstream), they hope to gain a better understanding of how to prevent disease, and in turn lower the cost of medication by offering people potentially more effective medication designed for their genetic profile, USA Today reports.

According to a professor of microbiology at Birmingham, England's Aston University, the answer is ... it depends on whether you're in your bedroom or kitchen. Anthony Hilton and his biology students looked at two types of bacteria (E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus) on three flooring options: carpet, laminate, tile. Toast, pasta, a cookie, and a  sticky sweet  were dropped on the various surfaces and rested there for 3 to 30 seconds. When it came to the transfer of bacteria, both time and flooring type played a role. Bacteria were least likely to hop aboard the fallen bite if carpet was involved; when  moist  foods hit laminate and tiled surfaces, bacteria was more likely to transfer when contact was made for more than 5 seconds. The upshot, per Hilton:  We have found evidence that transfer from indoor flooring surfaces is incredibly poor.  That's likely welcome news to the 87% of people the students surveyed who reported a willingness to adhere to the five-second rule. Writing for Forbes, Alice Walton notes that the findings should be taken with a grain of salt—preferably one not dropped on the floor. She points out that the study doesn't seem to have been peer-reviewed or accepted for publication anywhere.

I need him because he’s part of the family.  Forman took the condo board to court, and dragged them through a costly legal battle—which she won this week.

The condo board is probably pretty chagrined; Forman at one point offered to settle, but they turned her down.  They told a judge that they’d spent $100,000 already, so they can’t settle,  says Forman’s lawyer.",

Authorities say the 17-year-old, identified as Anneli-Marie R., was kidnapped while walking her dog near Meissen around 7:30pm last Thursday. About half an hour later, her father received a phone call from Anneli-Marie's phone: It was one of her captors demanding $1.3 million in ransom. Investigators say the last sounds he heard from his daughter were reportedly her screams on the line. Though the girl's family told the kidnappers in a letter that they would  fulfill your demands in order to be able to take our child in our arms again,  her body was found on a farm Monday, hours after the arrests of two men, 39 and 61, reports NBC News. Police—some 1,200 of them were involved in the case—say they found the suspects by tracking cell phones, reports NBC News. Authorities say the men, unmasked during the crime, probably killed Anneli-Marie on Friday so she wouldn't expose them to police; they found no evidence of sexual assault. Friday was the last day a kidnapper and the teen's father spoke; NBC News notes the family wanted to pay the ransom but couldn't wire it to a foreign bank as instructed in the specified time frame. Officials suspect there was a good deal of planning before the crime.  Based on the investigation so far, the younger suspect was supposedly taking walks with a dog in the area to find out at what times the girl was out and about,  says a rep for the Dresden prosecutors' office. Investigators believe the captors also researched her on Facebook. (Cops are stumped by the case of a missing Connecticut couple.)",

Maybe this is fodder for a Godzilla movie. I claim the movie rights!

Most recently, 74-year-old Tsuwa Suzuki was found dead in the Akita prefecture this weekend in an attack so severe that authorities could barely identify her. She was apparently killed while picking edible plants in a mountain forest. Three men, one in his sixties and two in their seventies, were also killed in the same area in separate incidents while picking bamboo shoots. Authorities responded to Suzuki's death by sending out a search team and fatally shooting a 4-foot-high, 154-pound female Asiatic black bear just 20 yards from where the woman was killed, Asahi Shimbun reports. Local vet Takeshi Komatsu says there may be only one perpetrator behind the maulings.  After tasting human flesh (for the first time), the bear may have realised that it can eat them,  Komatsu says. Yet sightings of black Asiatic bears and brown bears have soared in northern Japan this year, surpassing 1,200, which already doubles last year's count. An unusually high crop of beechnuts may have boosted the bear population by improving the nutrition of mother bears, Yomiuri Shimbun reports. Meanwhile, authorities are advising people to take precautions when walking around the mountains.  Bears normally avoid humans, so it's good to make them aware of your presence by using something like a bell,  says a member of a nonprofit that specializes in driving away bears.",

Don Chingon, a recently opened Mexican restaurant in Park Slope, is offering a 10% ownership stake in the eatery if you can complete the  Gran Chingon Challenge,  the Daily Meal reports. You simply have to pay the $150 entry fee and consume the eponymous  huge badass  burrito—which New York Daily News reporter Gersh Kuntzman describes as looking like  a large toddler … or a small coffin —in one hour.  If you are going to eat a massive amount of food and gain 25-30 [pounds] in a single sitting, you deserve real compensation,  the Chingon team tells Food & Wine.  Some restaurants will put your name on the wall. We'll just give you the wall.  The clock starts as soon as you touch the burrito—which the owner says contains about 25,000 calories—and competitors are disqualified if they take any bathroom breaks or there's  discharge [of] bodily fluids of any kind  (including running noses or eyes), Food & Wine notes; the eatery also says it isn't responsible if contenders get sick or die. Owner Victor Robey, who tells the Park Slope Stoop that he was inspired by shows like the Travel Channel's Man v.

If you're in the area and try (and likely fail) this challenge, don't feel too bad: Renowned eating champ Joey Chestnut broke the world burrito-eating record in May, and even he could scarf down just 14 pounds—though he was given only 10 minutes, per KUSA.

Some 65 years ago, a group of Germans who had fought with the Nazi-era Wehrmacht and Waffen-SS amassed an army. The revelation surfaced by way of a 321-page file unearthed by accident in the archives of the country's foreign intelligence agency (a historian hired by the BND to dig into the agency's origins found the documents, titled  insurances,  while trying to figure out how many employees the BND originally had). What Agilolf Kesselring found instead was details on the 1949 forming of a secret—and, under Allied law, illegal—army by some 2,000 ex-officers, who intended to protect West Germany against the Soviets or Eastern European countries; a study on the documents was published this week. Der Spiegel notes that the file  is incomplete and thus needs to be considered with some restraint,  but reports on what the document does reveal: That if an attack was launched from the East, 40,000 fighters would protect the country—whose own chancellor didn't even learn the group existed until 1951, and apparently made no moves to dissolve it. Der Spiegel explains in detail the involvement of Albert Schnez, a WWII colonel who was instrumental in founding the group, seeking funds from like-minded citizens, making contact with veterans groups, asking for help from the West German secret service (which gave it a small amount of money through 1953), and crafting an emergency plan that involved potentially making use of transportation company vehicles and police weapons in case of emergency. It's not clear when the army disbanded, though Der Spiegel notes that the 1955 creation of the Bundeswehr made it  redundant.",

Two of the five men were in custody, one in the US and one in the Netherlands.

Roberge is apparently something of a 911-dialing pro: The Connecticut Post reports that he's called the number 79 times since the beginning of the year. On one occasion, he offered the responding crew $20 and change to come sit with him inside. But Sunday's incident resulted in more than just the usual warning. He was charged with misuse of the 911 system and released after posting $500 bond. Click to read about more weird crimes.",

Sheriff Gregory Tony announced Wednesday that Edward Eason and Josh Stambaugh were terminated Tuesday for neglect of duty. The terminations resulted from an internal investigation into the police response to the shooting last February that left 17 students and teachers dead; seven officers were part of the inquest. Four of them have been terminated (and one of those, school resource officer Scot Peterson, was also arrested) and the other three will return to duty. Tony said a report will be released publicly at some point, NBC News reports. A public safety commission found last year that Eason did not immediately enter the school building, inside of which some people required immediate help. And a state commission found that Stambaugh heard the final gunshots yet did not move toward the school. (The former sheriff was suspended—and sued over it.)",

The British businessman and art collector says he bought a $2-million Andy Warhol painting for only $5 at a Las Vegas garage sale two years ago, the Daily Mail reports. In fact, he hardly noticed it until framing other pictures—then  recognized the bright red lips of an Andy Warhol,  he tells the BBC. But the Mail says doubts remain about the authenticity of the painting—a portrait of 1930s actor Rudy Vallee—which Warhol allegedly painted at age 11 or 12. Why, for example, is it signed  Andy Warhol  when the painter only changed his name from Andrew Warhola in 1949? Because, says Fields, Warhol signed his early paintings later in life. And Fields claims several experts have verified the painting as original. Also, he prefers to have it hung in a gallery rather than sold for megabucks. The work  moves the birth of Pop Art back two decades,  he says,  showing Warhol was already doing that sort of stuff at a far younger age.",

LaHaye died in a San Diego hospital days after having suffered a stroke, according to his publicist Johnnie Moore. Co-authored with Jerry B. Jenkins, the 16-volume Left Behind series sold more than 80 million copies worldwide, Moore said, and popularized a Bible interpretation that said born-again Christians will be instantly taken to God in the rapture, while those left behind on earth endure seven years of tribulation. LaHaye was a key figure in conservative political groups, encouraging the Rev. Jerry Falwell to create the Moral Majority and forming the Council for National Policy, a secretive strategy group for prominent political and religious conservatives. Along with his wife, Beverly, he started Concerned Women for America in 1979, as an alternative to liberal feminist organizations. LaHaye was also a prolific nonfiction writer, writing more than 60 additional books, including the Christian sex manual The Act of Marriage. Born in 1926, LaHaye had a hardscrabble upbringing in Detroit, served in the Air Force at the end of World War II and graduated from Bob Jones University. He earned a midcareer doctorate at Western Seminary in Portland, Ore., and joined the Southern Baptist Convention.

A school resource officer at Sidney Lanier Middle School learned of that post and others, and after interviewing students and seeking to obtain the IP address associated with the Instagram account, determined the 12-year-old Lanier student made the posts. She admitted to doing it, according to a search warrant, though she posted under the name of another student. Ultimately, Fairfax County schools deemed the threat  not credible,  a spokesperson says, but the girl was still charged. Her mother says her daughter is  a good kid  who's  never been in trouble before,  but that she posted the messages because she was getting bullied at school. A judge will ultimately have to determine whether the emojis she used were truly threatening, and the Post notes it's not the first time: A grand jury in New York recently declined to indict a 17-year-old who posted a police officer emoji followed by three gun emojis on Facebook and was charged with making a terrorist threat, and that's just one of several similar cases recently.  I think something is definitely lost in translation,  says that teen's lawyer.  These kids are not threatening cops, they are just trying to say, 'I’m tough.' It’s posturing.",

In a controversial new procedure, nine women have successfully received wombs from living relatives since September 2012, the doctor at the helm of the surgeries has revealed. The wombs are not connected to the women's fallopian tubes, so they still can't get pregnant the old-fashioned way, but they've had embryos created from their own eggs via in-vitro fertilization. Doctors will soon attempt to implant those embryos in their new uteri, the AP reports, and the wombs will be removed after a maximum of two pregnancies, so that the women can stop taking side-effect-ridden anti-rejection drugs. There have been two previous womb transplant attempts, one in Turkey and one in Saudi Arabia, but neither produced a baby.  This is a new kind of surgery,  says lead doctor Mats Brannstrom.  We have no textbook to look at.  And in an optimistic sign, many women got their periods as soon as six weeks after the transplant, says Brannstrom. But detractors say the method is too dangerous for live donors (in this case, all mothers or other female relatives of the women), given the number of adjacent blood vessels that must be removed to maintain blood flow.  Mats has done something amazing,  says the head of a parallel UK effort that will use only dead or dying donors.  But we are wary of that approach.",

Peachtree City Chief William McCollom called 911 early New Year's Day to report inadvertently shooting his ex-wife, Margaret, as they slept in their suburban Atlanta home. The shooting left Margaret McCollom paralyzed below the waist. District Attorney Scott Ballard says investigators found no evidence McCollom intended to harm Margaret. However, he concluded the shooting could have been prevented. The investigation showed that McCollom, a former firearms instructor, woke during the night when he heard barking dogs, prompting him to grab his service handgun and search the house. He returned to bed with the gun and told investigators he woke next to the sound of a gunshot, Ballard says. The chief, who said he drank alcohol and took medication to help him sleep, said he suspected he might have been trying in his sleep to move the gun to a nightstand.  The gun was in the bed, I went to move it, and I put it to a side and it went off,  McCollom told a 911 dispatcher. His Margaret told police that she was asleep when the shooting happened but believed it was an accident, according to state investigators. The couple divorced in 1999 but later reunited.  When I look at the facts, it appears to me that this is reckless conduct,  Ballard says. If convicted, McCollom could face a year in jail. He resigned from the chief's job in March.",

That's because the school's oft-touted claim that since 1975, 90% of its graduates looking for employment found jobs in their field within six months actually has no basis in fact, according to the Department of Education. The university was asked to back up the assertion last year, but it  could not provide evidence to substantiate this claim,  the department announced Thursday. As part of a settlement, DeVry must now abandon the claim, post a notice on its website for two years noting the claim is unproven, and keep at least $68.4 million in reserves in case of any future issues, report NPR and the Wall Street Journal. However, unlike competitors Corinthian Colleges and ITT Technical Institute—which recently folded after missteps—DeVry will keep its access to federal funding.

The colony of chinstrap penguins relies for food on krill, which depend on algae that attach to ice, which is rapidly disappearing, scientists note. The team from Madrid's National Museum of Natural Sciences tallied chinstrap penguins in the Vapour Col colony of Deception Island in the Antarctic's Shetland Islands, and photographed nests in 19 subcolonies from 1991 to 2009. The number of occupied nests in that time period plummeted by 36%, with the steepest declines occurring since 2000. The population of a nearby chinstrap colony on Bailey Head has plummeted by 50%, according to the team's findings in Polar Biology. The population declines  constitute a general pattern  in the South Shetlands, and are particularly troubling as  population changes of top predators provide key indications of environmental quality,  writes lead researcher Andres Barbosa.

Security cameras spotted violinist Phillip Johnson, then 27, lingering outside the room and Johnson's ex-girlfriend later said he had taken it. Without proof, Totenberg could only hope he would one day see his  musical partner of 38 years  again. His wish went unfulfilled: He died in 2012 at age 101 without knowing where his violin—the Ames Stradivarius—was. Today, it falls back into the hands of the Totenberg family at a ceremony in New York, reports the violinist's daughter and NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg. She says the FBI called her in June to say the violin had surfaced in a locked case left to Johnson’s ex-wife when he died of cancer in 2011. Appraiser Phillip Injeian, contacted by Johnson's ex-wife, doubted the Stradivarius' authenticity since just 550 are known to exist. Photos looked  so remarkably good,  however, that he arranged a meeting. After half an hour,  I said these words, 'Well, I've got good news for you, and I've got bad news for you,'  Injeian says.  'The good news is that this is a Stradivarius. The bad news it was stolen 35, 36 years ago from Roman Totenberg.'  Injeian reported the discovery to FBI agents, who found its measurements precisely matched those of Totenberg's instrument, as did pearl on the tuning pegs. Nina Totenberg tells the New York Times the Strad, now likely worth millions, will be sold to  another great artist who will play it in concert halls all over the world.

Law requires the agency to pay private air carriers above the market rate for shipments there, and the agency then charges retailers just half of the commercial shipping price. The results have hammered a struggling Postal Service: Thanks to the subsidies, the agency has lost $2.5 billion over 33 years, the Washington Post reports. Last year alone, the subsidies cost the USPS $77.5 million, officials say; the money comes from the Postal Service's customers.

A pallet of drinks, for instance, cost the Postal Service $3,200 to send, but Alaska Commercial paid only $485 for the postage. Even so, a 12-pack of Coke from the shipment cost a family more than $15 at the Alaska Commercial store. It's all because of an earmark by former senator Ted Stevens to ensure delivery to remote Alaska—but that was 33 years ago, and these days the Postal Service's finances are dangerously tight.

Former Athletic Director Tim Curley and former Vice President Gary Schultz originally were charged with felonies. The reduced charge is punishable by up to five years in prison. Penn State ex-President Graham Spanier was also charged; his prosecution appears to be moving forward, with jury selection set for next week. The three handled a 2001 complaint by a graduate assistant who said he saw Sandusky, a retired defensive football coach, sexually abusing a boy in a team shower. They did not report the matter to police or child welfare authorities, but barred Sandusky from bringing children to campus. Sandusky was not arrested until a decade later. He was convicted in 2012 of 45 counts of sexual abuse of 10 boys, and is serving a 30- to 60-year state prison term. Shortly after Sandusky's arrest, Paterno was fired. Schultz and Curley were arrested in 2011, and Spanier in 2012. The three former administrators at Penn State had also faced conspiracy charges. Each felony count carried the possibility of seven years in prison. Their case has dragged on for years because of a dispute about their representation during a grand jury appearance by Penn State's then-chief counsel Cynthia Baldwin.

Wayne has left his body, passing away through the night,  his family wrote on Facebook yesterday.  He always said he couldn't wait for this next adventure to begin and had no fear of dying.  Dyer, who spent time in orphanages and Detroit's foster system as a child, eventually served in the Navy before going to Wayne State University to study counseling. In 1976, he published his first book—Your Erroneous Zones: Step-by-Step Advice for Escaping the Trap of Negative Thinking and Taking Control of Your Life—and it went on to become one of the best-selling books of all time. Dyer discussed his  self-actualization philosophy,  which the Washington Post refers to as  Christian-y  and  Buddhist-ish,  on shows including Oprah's, Phil Donahue's, and Sally Jessy Raphael's. He officiated Ellen DeGeneres' and Portia de Rossi's wedding. A sample Dyer quote, per CBS News:  Take the last five minutes of your day and put your attention on everything that you would like to attract into your life. ... Then you'll marinate for eight hours, and you'll awaken and you'll begin to attract the things that are in your subconscious mind.  His family did not reveal the cause of his death, but Dyer was diagnosed with chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 2009; he claimed that the power of positive thinking and a Brazilian doctor's  psychic surgery  healed him. Per USA Today, Dyer once noted that such illnesses are likely  just the body's way of responding to, perhaps, psychological traumas  in a person's past.",

Any belly I had I thought was just a food baby from all the eating I’d done in Europe over two months,  the Australian woman says. But in Spain, she felt a little odd and took a pregnancy test; it came back positive, the Herald Sun reports. She figured she must have recently gotten pregnant and traveled on, but she then found out from an obstetrician in Prague in late August that she was 33 weeks along. She quickly returned home to Melbourne, only to find she was actually 38 weeks along (or possibly more, as re-testing indicated she was overdue). Days later, she had a healthy baby boy, Mason—which was a relief, considering the circumstances.  Obviously, having not known for so long, I was exercising heaps, jumping off cliffs, riding bikes, drinking alcohol, and eating anything and everything,  she says.  I had absolutely no real clear symptoms,  Hudson tells The Young Mummy blog.  I was still getting regular periods. I wasn't nauseous, no morning sickness, little weight gain.  (She was still a size 6 when she flew home, the Daily Mail reports.) It wasn't until just after she started her trip—since her boyfriend wasn't coming along, she went off birth control while overseas—that she stopped getting her period and started to suspect they'd gotten pregnant just before she left. Even after getting the positive pregnancy test,  I wasn't showing at all and had no symptoms,  she says. In fact, it wasn't until her flight home that she felt her baby kick for the first time. So how is this possible? Doctors told Hudson she had a tilted uterus and Mason was sitting high in her diaphragm, so it wasn't obvious that she was expecting. As WhatToExpect.com explains, a tilted or  retroverted  uterus leans backward toward your spine instead of forward toward your navel, and it can also sometimes mean that  your doctor may have trouble finding your baby with a transabdominal ultrasound  because the baby's  a bit farther away from those trying to get a peek at him.

What scratch looks like: The XQ team asks educators, parents, students, and thought leaders to submit their ideas on how schools could and should be better, with an initial concept due Nov. 15. The multi-stage process will see winners announced next August.  We will partner with winning teams and provide them expert support and a fund of $50 million to support at least five schools [and as many as 10, per the Times] over the next five years to turn their ideas into real Super Schools.

Instead, McKee, 16, and Martinez, 17, pulled off  some very heinous, nasty crimes,  Upper Darby Police Superintendent Michael Chitwood says, and they've now been charged as adults for the armed robberies of two taxi drivers, which took place just hours apart June 19 in Upper Darby, CBS Philly reports. In the cab crimes, which are said to have taken place at gunpoint (though Chitwood notes the teens say it was just a BB gun), police say the girls made off with a grand total of $100 from one taxi, $80 from the second. The girls are also accused of robbing two women from Ecuador, identified by NBC Philadelphia as a mother and daughter, at gunpoint on June 23 in Upper Darby. The teens have been charged with aggravated assault and related offenses in all three cases. In the Ecuador case, $900 and a cellphone were taken from the 86-year-old and 52-year-old tourists, who were also assaulted. The girls are also suspected of the carjacking robberies of two Philly pizza delivery drivers. Martinez's 11-year-old sister, meanwhile, suffered a broken arm when one of the getaway cars that she was riding in crashed, Chitwood tells the Delaware County Daily Times. While cops seek out a male adult they think was involved in planning the crimes and possibly serving as the getaway driver, they note a somewhat happy ending: Two anonymous locals came forward with $1,000 for each of the Ecuadorian women.

That's because the town's government is initiating a pretty appealing sounding experiment: testing a 30-hour workweek, in which workers will be paid as if they're working full-time. The hope is that the six-hour days will bump up mental and physical well-being, increasing efficiency while reducing the number of sick days that are taken. The deputy mayor says the plan has been in the works for a while, though the opposition is dismissing it as a political ploy ahead of 2014 elections. Regardless, it's going forward, with a somewhat scientific approach involving control and test groups. One unlucky department will stick with its regular schedule; the Independent reports by way of Sweden's Metro newspaper that the elderly care department will drop to 30 hours per week for a year, then the results will be compared. The Local reports that the mayor says a car factory in town recently tried the six-hour day, with positive results. But the Local in 2005 reported on another town, Kiruna, whose municipal employees logged six-hour days for 16 years before it gave up the approach in the absence of clear health or productivity benefits.",

The retailer of high-end home goods said Williams died of natural causes Saturday at home in San Francisco. Williams opened his first Williams-Sonoma store in Sonoma, Calif., in 1956 inspired by a trip to Paris three years earlier. A lover of cooking and entertaining, he wanted US professional chefs and home cooks to have access to high-quality cookware and tools.  I couldn't get over seeing so many great things for cooking, the heavy pots and pans, white porcelain ovenware, country earthenware, great tools and professional knives,  Williams told the Washington Post in 2005. He refurbished the store off Sonoma's town square, with custom shelving to display pots and pans and a simple logo with  Williams  and  Sonoma  in block letters over a woodcut pineapple—a symbol of hospitality. The shop was such an enormous success that in 1958, he relocated to a 3,000-square-foot store in San Francisco. Julia Child's landmark 1961 cookbook, Mastering the Art of French Cooking, and her show sent even more cooks to Williams-Sonoma and by 11 years later, that store had expanded to twice its original size and the catalog was flourishing. Williams sold the company in 1979, but remained closely involved.  We must be thankful for his vision and commitment; for what he did has impacted kitchens and restaurants worldwide,  said renowned chef Thomas Keller.  Chuck Williams once said, 'If you love what you do, then the world will fall in love with you.' We fell for you, Chuck, and we thank you for touching our lives.",

That’s when the divorce rate reached its peak in the US, the Washington Post reports. The longer marriages are attributable in part to people getting hitched later in life, after they’ve finished their educations, sociologists say. Older brides and grooms are more mature and more financially stable.  People seem to be finding a new marriage bargain that works for 21st-century couples,  notes one analyst.  It’s based on pooling two incomes, replacing the old breadwinner-homemaker bargain that worked well in the ’50s.",

        "news": "(Feb 10, 2015  8:58 AM) Lest we forget: The Equal Justice Initiative today released a report that documents 3,959  racial terror lynchings  throughout 12 Southern states over the 1877 to 1950 period. That's  at least 700 more lynchings of black people in these states than previously reported,  reports the EJI in what it calls  the most comprehensive work done on lynching to date,  the result of four years of research. The New York Times reports that in 1882, the Chicago Tribune started annually publishing a list of the prior year's lynchings; the Tuskegee Institute and NAACP published lists in the early 20th century, and researchers in 1995 used all the existing documentation to create a master list. As for the 700 names that hadn't previously been recorded, one of those 1995 researchers, EM Beck, says that the definition of a lynching varies from list to list (the EJI's includes some  one-time massacres of large numbers of African-Americans,  per the Times). But  if you're trying to make a point that the amount of racial violence is underestimated, well then, there's no doubt about it,  says Beck. The report asserts the lynchings were a form of terrorism, writing they  were not 'frontier justice' because they generally took place in communities where there was a functioning criminal justice system that was deemed too good for African Americans.  Further,  racial terror lynching was ... a tactic for maintaining racial control, not merely punishment of an alleged perpetrator for an alleged crime.  The report illustrates some of the social grievances men were lynched for: knocking on a white woman's door (General Lee, 1904, Reevesville, SC) and bumping into a white woman while running to catch a train (Jeff Brown, 1916, Cedar Bluff, Miss.). The EJI hopes to erect memorials or markers at some of the lynching sites; the Guardian reports few currently exist and notes that EJI Director Bryan Stevenson expects challenges in terms of securing funding and approval.",

John Joe Gray was charged with assaulting a state trooper in 1999, but he refused to show up in court, instead shutting himself up in his 47-acre compound and kicking off what is believed to be the longest armed standoff in US history. After holing up on his property, Gray warned law enforcement to  bring body bags  if they came to get him, reports the New York Times. They never did, and Gray hasn't left since. Supporters—including Chuck Norris at one point—brought food and supplies as Gray's family and friends patrolled the property with guns. The strange part: WFAA reports the standoff technically ended in 2014, when the outgoing DA dropped the charge against Gray, but nobody apparently told either side. Henderson County Sheriff Ray Nutt, informed this week by a reporter, called the DA's office himself to confirm the news, reports the Times.  He actually could walk out tomorrow and be a free man,  says Nutt.  He’s no longer a fugitive.  But when a reporter relayed the same message at Gray's property, it was met with skepticism.  We can’t believe anything they say, and we can’t believe anything y’all reporters say,  said a woman armed with a rifle.

Germany has announced that the tens of thousands of gay men convicted under Paragraph 175 will see that conviction annulled and may receive compensation. The Guardian has a timeline of the law, which established homosexuality as a crime: Born in 1872, the law was embraced by Nazis some 50 years later; the New York Times reports 100,000 men were charged under the Nazis, with half ending up in prison and as many as 15,000 sent to concentration camps, where a pink triangle was affixed to their uniform. When the war ended, the law did not. More than 50,000 men were convicted under it between 1946 and 1969 when homosexuality was decriminalized, and a few thousand more even after that in West Germany. The Nazi-era convictions were lifted at the turn of the 21st century, but there was no post-war relief until Wednesday's announcement by Justice Minister Heiko Maas, which  amounted to an apology,  reports the Times. He said in part,  Paragraph 175 was from the very beginning unconstitutional. The old convictions are unjust [and] do huge injury to the human dignity of each convicted man.  Wednesday brought one more big step forward for gays: Italy's Parliament voted 372 to 51 to recognize same-sex civil unions, reports the Times, which frames Italy as having been  perhaps the most prominent exception  among the Western nations that had already done so.",

Males in general were involved in 80% of cases, but those 21-34 had a role in 32% of offenses, though that gender and age group makes up just 11% of the population, report NBC News and LiveScience. Hawaii had the highest per-capita rate with 995 alcohol-impaired driving episodes annually per 1,000 people. Nebraska, North Dakota, and Wisconsin also had high rates at 955, 855, and 828 cases, respectively. Utah had the lowest rate with 217 episodes—not much of a surprise considering the state also had the lowest rate of adult drinkers at 31%, compared to 65% in Wisconsin. Interestingly, the study also found that people who didn't religiously buckle up reported driving impaired three times more than those who always buckled up.  Fatalities among alcohol-impaired drivers could be substantially reduced if every state had a primary seat belt law,  the team writes. (Scientists have determined there are four kinds of drunks.)",

But he's also on a mission to save an Amazonian village that he once called home, California Sunday Magazine reports. Years ago, the indigenous Cofán people of Ecuador sent 10-year-old Lucitante to Seattle to learn English and get an education. They also hoped he would return to fight oil companies they believe are threatening their way of life. But Lucitante, now 27 and married to an American, has other responsibilities—like a baby girl and bills to pay. Still, he carries the flame by studying public speaking and traveling back and forth with his wife to his home village of Zábalo. He feels like a symbol,  like a dolphin for Save the Ocean,  says Lucitante, but  I'm sure I'll never feel like I'm doing enough.  The Cofán struggle with Westerners goes back hundreds of years, when European diseases likely killed off thousands. Then, in the 1960s, oil companies began drilling in a Cofán village, forcing a general retreat; deforestation, oil spills, and sickness followed, along with a lawsuit including the Cofán as plaintiffs. The Cofán protected a swath of land, but also persuaded an idealistic US college student to take 10-year-old Lucitante to Seattle and raise him. Adaptation to America was tough, but helping the Cofán may be harder: Lucitante, subject of the documentary Oil & Water, wants them to have better schools, stronger homes, and a drone to monitor illegal mining and logging.

Jose has long been the most popular name for Hispanic boys born in the country, but last year saw only 7,656 new ones, the lowest number in more than three decades. Jose also got supplanted by Jacob as the top name in Texas, a spot it had held since 1996. The development comes even with Hispanic birthrates on the rise.  This is probably a combination of assimilation and the drop in immigration from Latin America as a result of the recession,  says one expert.  However, it is probable that names are also becoming more varied in Latin American culture itself, as this is a phenomenon in most of the modern world.

The S&P 500 also broke records this morning, rising six points (0.3%) to 2,084. This followed on the heels of news that the US economy grew at a sizzling 5% annual rate in the July-September period, the fastest in more than a decade, boosted by strength in consumer spending and business investment. The Commerce Department today sharply revised up its estimate of third-quarter growth from a previous figure of 3.9%. Much of that strength came from consumer spending on health care and business spending on structures and computer software. It was the fastest quarterly growth since the summer of 2003 and followed a 4.6% annual growth rate in the April-June quarter. Most economists think growth is slowing to an annual rate of around 2.5% in the current October-December quarter and foresee growth around 3% in 2015—the strongest figure since the economy expanded 3.3% in 2005, two years before the Great Recession began. Even after the recession ended in June 2009, the economy has turned in mediocre growth rates, averaging 2.2% annually. But many analysts think growth is finally set to accelerate as more businesses have grown confident about hiring, with the country on track to have its healthiest year for job growth since 1999. In November, employers added 321,000 jobs, the biggest one-month increase in three years. Solid gains are expected in consumer spending, which accounts for about 70% of the economy.",

To figure out what makes the residents of this mountainous region in the middle of the Mediterranean so long-lived—and hopefully use that knowledge to develop drugs and treatments to help out the rest of us—biotech company Tiziana Life Sciences just paid more than $280,000 for a  biobank  of DNA samples from nearly 13,000 Ogliastra residents, the Guardian reports. It's one of the  largest and oldest  collections of DNA samples in the world. Mountains in Ogliastra have isolated its villages for generations, leading to a  high rate of inbreeding  and a genetically homogeneous population. That could mean residents share genetic traits protecting them from certain diseases.  Part of it is the environment and the diet, of course, but part of it might be something genetic that we don’t yet know about,  Tiziana CEO Gabriele Cerrone tells the Times. Cerrone says Ogliastra is one of only three regions in the world with an impressively high number of centenarians. There are currently 91 living in the province.

Meanwhile, the Hispanic population in the Mountain West helped Obama in 2008. If the president can repeat John Kerry's 2004 victories and add Virginia and North Carolina—or combine a victory in one of those states with wins in Colorado and Nevada—he will win the election, an insider says. The Journal notes that he took all four in 2008.",

        "news": "(Jul 17, 2015  8:16 AM CDT) A new study offers some rather depressing news for those of you who are obese: You’re probably going to stay that way. Researchers at King's College London monitored the weight of 278,982 Brits, including 176,000 who were obese, from 2004 to 2014. Excluding those who had weight loss surgery, just 1,283 obese men and 2,245 women returned to a normal body weight during that time, reports the BBC. That means obese men had just a 0.5% chance of getting back to a healthy weight level each year. For women, the rate of success was 0.8%, or  almost impossible,  a researcher tells HealthDay. For those morbidly obese, the figure was even less encouraging: less than 0.15% for women and much less for men. While 8% of men and 10% of women were able to lose at least 5% of their body weight within a year, more than half had regained the weight two years later, while 78% had after five years, according to a press release. The fact that this yo-yo effect—the cycle of people losing weight, only to gain it back again—was so prevalent shows weight loss strategies for the obese are simply inadequate, researchers say.  Current strategies that focus on cutting calories and boosting physical activity aren't working for most patients to achieve weight loss and maintain that,  says Alison Fildes, lead author of the study, published in the American Journal of Public Health (researchers didn't monitor how the study participants attempted to lose weight, however). While cutting 5% to 10% of body weight has significant health benefits for the obese—including lowered blood pressure and blood sugar, reports HealthDay— priority needs to be placed on preventing weight gain in the first place,  says Fildes. (Our weights have changed dramatically since the 1960s.)",

But this is not your typical case of this variety: Alstory Simon is actually the second person to be freed after a murder conviction for the crime, which is why the Chicago Sun-Times is using phrases like  a stunning reversal,  while the Chicago Tribune says the move is  rewriting a key chapter in Illinois' death penalty history.  The case goes back to 1982, when somebody shot to death Marilyn Green and fiance Jerry Hillard. Prosecutors first convicted Anthony Porter, who ended up on death row. But 48 hours before he was to die, his conviction got thrown out, thanks to the work of Northwestern University's Medill Innocence Project. One of the project's investigators got Simon to confess to the crime, but both Simon and the investigator later said the confession was coerced. (Simon, now 64, was promised a short sentence, followed by riches from book and movie deals.) The reversal of Porter's conviction led first to a moratorium on the death penalty in Illinois less than a year after Porter was pardoned in 1999, and eventually to its abolishment in the state in 2011. The double-murder case is now once again unofficially unsolved. Multiple witnesses put Porter at the crime scene, and at least one says he saw Porter pull the trigger. Cook County prosecutors, however, aren't saying whether they think he's guilty. It's a moot point: Porter cannot be tried again thanks to double jeopardy.",

The strollers being recalled are older versions of the Graco Quattro Tour and MetroLite strollers and travel systems, all made before 2007 and distributed by Graco Children's Products of Atlanta. If babies aren't strapped into the strollers properly, they can slide through the opening between the stroller tray and bottom of the seat—where they can get stuck and be strangled.

Kevin Dumont climbed the slide at Liquid Planet on Nov. 9 in a bid to attract investors interested in saving the business. He said Wednesday on Facebook there were no takers and that a doctor believes he is developing pneumonia.  Dear friends and supporters, it is with profound sadness that I must tell you that my attempts to find a partner in time to save the waterpark from auction has failed,  he wrote.  I had a number of interested parties but there just wasn't enough time to get the details worked out before the December 2nd auction. I tried my best to have the auction delayed but unfortunately I could not make it happen.  Dumont, a genial 46-year-old Army veteran with nine years of service, opened the park in 2008. Two wet summers kept crowds away and a series of financial problems immediately followed. Late this season, the state temporarily shut down two of his new waterslides when they were found to have high levels of bacteria. The state also said he put up the slides without a required review.  We've done things, taken short term loans, worked for free to try to keep it going,  Dumont told the AP the day before he ended his effort.  But unfortunately, our loan just wasn't performing. The bank had to call our loan.  A GoFundMe page raised just $1,945 toward a $1 million goal, and interest from four potential investors didn't lead to a rescue. A total of $1.6 million was needed to keep the property—including his home—off the auction block. Click for more on how Dumont spent the 17 days (including how he went to the bathroom).",

And—unlike Jackson— Alexander Hamilton is not someone that people have a problem with.

The boy, IDed by the International Business Times as Abrahim Hassan, was born in Mexico to Jordanian parents, and embryologists are hoping his successful birth will hasten using the procedure elsewhere. Abrahim's mother, Shaban, carries the gene for Leigh syndrome—a severe neurological condition that decimates mental and physical capabilities and often results in a child's death before kindergarten. Although Hassan herself is healthy, her first two children died from the disease. That's when she and her husband looked for assistance from NYC's New Hope Fertility Center, where a team led by Dr. John Zhang started them off on an alternative way to parenthood. There are a couple of different ways to pull off the three-parent technique, but the one they chose to go with is called spindle nuclear transfer, in which the nucleus from the mother's egg is placed in a donor egg whose own nucleus has been taken out; that egg, which then contains nuclear DNA from the mom and mitochondrial DNA from the donor, is fertilized with the father's sperm. Five embryos were created in this case, and when just one  took,  it was implanted into Hassan, who delivered Abrahim nine months later. This all had to be done in Mexico, where Zhang says  there are no rules  (the Times labels it  relatively flexible legislation ; the procedure isn't approved in the US). One concern scientists are keeping an eye on: faulty mitochondria that could replicate, a problem that may have occurred when the technique was last tried in the '90s.

Several Iraqi politicians attended the first court session, seeing the trial as a test of the country's independent judiciary. Although his lawyer argued that the charges against Zaidi were overly harsh, he could have faced up to 15 years in jail under Saddam-era sentencing guidelines.",

Kim Ki-jong was convicted of attempted murder, assaulting a foreign envoy, and obstruction, according to a Seoul Central District Court spokesman. Both Kim and the prosecution have one week to determine whether to appeal. Prosecutors had previously asked for a 15-year prison term. Kim slashed Mark Lippert during a breakfast forum in Seoul, leaving deep gashes on the envoy's face and arm. Lippert, who needed 80 stitches, was treated for five days at a Seoul hospital. Kim has described himself as an anti-US activist. He told police that his assault was meant to protest annual US-South Korean military drills but that he didn't intend to kill the ambassador. Police said Kim attempted to kill Lippert because he knifed him more than twice with a force that was enough to penetrate the ambassador's arm as he tried to block the attack. During earlier police questioning, Kim also said South Korea is a semi-colony of the US, according to Seoul police. Shortly after his arrest, Kim shouted that the war games were an obstacle against Korean reunification. (Pyongyang described the attack as a  knife shower of justice. )",

Born in London in 1909 to parents of German-Jewish descent, Winton himself was raised as a Christian. He was a 29-year-old clerk at the London Stock Exchange when a friend contacted him and told him to cancel the skiing holiday they had planned in late 1938 and travel instead to Czechoslovakia. Alarmed by the influx of refugees from the Sudetenland region recently annexed by Germany, Winton and his friend feared—correctly—that Czechoslovakia soon would be invaded by the Nazis and Jewish residents from there would be sent to concentration camps. While supporters in Britain were working to get Jewish intellectuals and Communists out of Czechoslovakia, little focus was put on trying to save the children, so Winton took the task upon himself. He persuaded British officials to accept children, as long as foster homes were found and a 50-pound guarantee was paid for each to ensure they had enough money to return home later. Winton set about finding homes and guarantors, and in the months before the outbreak of World War II, Winton got 669 children out, mostly via train. The largest evacuation was scheduled for Sept. 3, 1939, the day that Britain declared war on Germany. That train never left, and almost none of the 250 children trying to flee on it survived the war. For almost 50 years, Winton said nothing about what he had done before the war. It only emerged in 1988 when his wife, Grete, found documents in their attic.

Even if Apple is underestimating the NSA's abilities, the principle isn't sitting well with FBI chief James Comey.

It’s building systems that prevent everyone who might want your data—including hackers, malicious insiders, and even hostile foreign governments—from accessing your phone.

Three men were sent to Georgia and two to Slovakia for resettlement.

The release of the men, four Yemenis and a Tunisian, brings the prison population to 143, around 100 fewer than when President Obama took office vowing to close the center. Obama's vow to close Guantanamo was thwarted by Congress, which prohibited sending any prisoner to the US and imposed restrictions that brought releases to a halt. Congress eased the transfer restrictions last December, and releases have resumed. A number of resettlements are expected in the coming weeks. US State Department envoy Clifford Sloan has been trying to persuade countries to accept prisoners, and he praises Georgia and Slovakia.

Two Egyptian fishing boats were hijacked yesterday and a Greek-owned freighter with at least 20 crew on board was seized before dawn today by pirates evidently undeterred by the recent standoff with the US Navy. The freighter reported a suspicious vessel but received no response on emergency channels, according to a security contractor. The nighttime attack on the freighter shows that the pirates are acquiring more advanced technology with the spoils of earlier hijackings, analysts said. President Obama vowed to  halt the rise of piracy  at a news conference yesterday. Military officials say options on the table include sending more US Navy gunships to patrol Somalia's coast and taking steps to disable pirate  mother ships.",

A few years ago, a portion was distributed in $1 coins, but they were a bit heavy to haul around—so this year, Hornady Manufacturing opted for $2 bills. Bosses handed out $61,000 worth of the rare bills, an increase on last year's $48,000, they tell the Grand Island Independent. Why the odd system?  Two years ago, we caught a lot of flack from the city council and some people in the city of Grand Island for how we don’t support the community ... which we disagreed with,  explains VP Jason Hornady. To prove the complaints weren't true, the company chose to make its contribution clear by paying $2-bill bonuses.  (We) asked our employees to spend that money in town, and if people look at you funny, tell them where you work, and we think that they will notice,  Hornady says. The company orders the bills about a month in advance, he notes. Fortunately, the 300 workers don't have to deal entirely in $2 bills:  They also receive a nice check and a deposit into their 401(k)s,  he adds. Hornady isn't the first company to use the tactic: In 2009, a pharmacist made a similar move in Alabama, the Press-Register reported. (Of course, not everyone welcomes pay in small denominations.)",

Rehoboth Beach Police Lt. Jaime Riddle says 55-year-old Susan Terrillion was arrested Tuesday and charged with endangering the welfare of her 8-year-old and 9-year-old kids after she left them in their vacation rental while she went to pick up their dinner order at an eatery about 5 miles away, the News Journal reports. She was gone for at least 45 minutes, which was enough time for the kids to go outside and lose control of their dogs, who then apparently dashed in front of a man's car, Riddle says. That witness tells cops he helped the kids rein the animals in, then found out there was no adult around supervising them. Woman's Day points out such a situation can often prove tricky from a legal standpoint: There's no federal law mandating a minimum age at which kids can be left alone, and state rules vary. In Delaware's case, there's no  appropriate age  to use as a gauge, but the  Division of Family Services will accept for investigation any report of a child under the age of 12 being left alone.  Terrillion was arrested and released on $500 bail; the kids and dogs are said to be OK. In another case of child endangerment in Rehoboth Beach, per Delaware State News: A Canadian dad was arrested last week for allegedly letting his 13-year-old daughter lure a seagull into a hole with food, then hit it with a plastic shovel, killing it.

The decision was a setback for Nestle—which manages the brand overseas; Hershey is licensed to sell the brand here in the US—and a victory for Cadbury, which was trying to block the trademark. The ruling means that, for now, other candy companies can make similar-looking chocolate bars. Nestle, which reaped more than $60 million a year from 2008 to 2010 in the UK from KitKat, argued that the four-fingered design has become inextricably associated with the KitKat brand over the past eight decades, Bloomberg notes. But Cadbury said the shape wasn't enough to make a consumer automatically think  KitKat,  and the court agreed. The BBC even notes that in Norway, a lesser-known chocolate bar called Kvikk Lunsj ( quick lunch ) has been around for nearly as long as KitKat. The fight between the two confectionary giants is the second major brouhaha they've had in recent years: In 2013, Nestle managed to block Cadbury's attempts to trademark its signature purple-colored chocolate wrappers, per Bloomberg.

Ladislas Ntaganzwa was arrested in the eastern Congo city of Goma late Monday, according to Rwandan Prosecutor General Richard Muhumuza. Ntaganzwa is among the nine most-wanted fugitives in the 1994 Rwanda genocide, which killed more than 800,000 ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus. The UN's International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda sought Ntaganzwa to answer charges related to participation in genocide and incitement to commit genocide, but closed its proceedings last week after nearly 20 years of pursuing and prosecuting genocide suspects and transferred Ntaganzwa's case to Rwanda. Muhumuza said the country has started extradition proceedings for Ntaganzwa to stand trial in Rwanda. According to ICTR's indictment of Ntaganzwa, he is accused of substantially participating in the planning, preparation, and execution of the massacre of over 20,000 Tutsis at Cyahinda Parish from around April 14 to 18, 1994, when he was mayor of Nyakizu. On April 15, 1994, Ntaganzwa, armed with a gun, transported gendarmes in a vehicle while Hutu civilians and Burundian refugees he had incited earlier arrived on foot and surrounded Cyahinda Parish to prevent the Tutsis from escaping, the indictment says. He then gave the order for the massacre to begin, and many Tutsis were killed or harmed. Ntaganzwa is also wanted for allegedly orchestrating and leading a massacre of thousands of Tutsis elsewhere and ordering rape.",

Because the wells are located on tribal land, Oklahoma regulators have no jurisdiction over oil- and gas-producing facilities in the region, reports the AP. The 17 wells are located in a 211-square-mile area within Osage County, near where a magnitude 5.6 temblor struck Saturday, leaving one man with a minor head injury. At least 11 homes and several Oklahoma State University campus buildings were reportedly damaged.  The USGS cannot currently conclude whether or not this particular earthquake was caused by industrial-related, human activities,  the USGS said in a statement, via the Wall Street Journal.  However, we do know that many earthquakes in Oklahoma have been triggered by wastewater fluid injection.   We are working closely with the state of Oklahoma, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Osage Nation to evaluate available information and take appropriate next steps to protect public health and the environment,  an EPA rep says. State regulators, which since 2013 have asked wastewater-well owners to reduce disposal volumes in parts of the state, already had ordered 37 wells in a 514 square-mile area around the epicenter of Saturday's earthquake to shut down within seven to 10 days because of previous connections between the injection of wastewater and earthquakes. Meanwhile, two more earthquakes of magnitude 4.1 and 3.6 rattled northwest Oklahoma on Tuesday, in an area away from Saturday's quake. There were no reports of damage or injuries.",

Not so, says writer WC Jameson. In Amelia Earhart: Beyond the Grave, out Tuesday, Jameson builds on the existing theory that Earhart was a spy and was shot down by the Japanese (or captured after a crash or forced landing) and taken prisoner while on a mission to photograph Japanese military installations in the Pacific, Fox News reports. FDR knew about the whole thing, per Jameson, but kept it quiet. Released by the Japanese in 1945, he claims, Earhart returned to the US and lived under the name Irene Craigmile Bolam until she died in 1982, when she would have been about 86. The theory that Earhart was a spy and that she and Noonan were taken prisoner has been around for some time. Early last year a group of men traveled to the Marshall Islands (which was held at the time by the Japanese military, Red Orbit notes) to hunt for evidence to back up the claim, WKYC reports. They found about six pieces of metal they believe came from Earhart's plane. They were having the items tested for authenticity, but there's been no word on the results. For his book, Jameson reportedly interviewed the nephew of a former US Army official who said it was common knowledge in  high-ranking intelligence circles  that Earhart was  involved in an intelligence-gathering operation.  Jameson also claims that flight logs from the last Coast Guard station she communicated with were altered after her disappearance. (Click for another intriguing Earhart theory.)",

Adolescent girls fetch $124, while women over 20 are sold for less. The organized price list is just another way ISIS differs from other militant groups, Bangura says.

Even if a trial does occur, the Guardian paints the suit as having a  remote chance of success.  The suits' defendants—manufacturer Remington, a distributor, and a local gun shop—reference the 2005 federal shield law that has stopped most would-be suits by victims of gun violence, as it provides the makers and sellers with immunity when their guns are used in a crime. And so the plaintiffs are going after them via a  creative legal move,  per the Guardian: The shield doesn't cover negligent entrustment, in which someone who shouldn't have a gun is sold one.

Police said Monday that the entourage members acted in self-defense in that shooting at the Trump International Beach Resort Miami in Sunny Isles Beach. Police say 11 men were detained for questioning then released after the shooting near the Trump resort, which also injured a 5-year-old boy and Kaylyn Marie Long, a 19-year-old believed to be Youngboy's girlfriend. In another shooting, Chicago-based rapper AAB Hellabandz died early Saturday after being shot in Miami Beach. Another man was injured in the shooting, and two police officers were injured when their vehicles collided while pursuing a vehicle thought to have been involved. On Friday, shots were fired at a performer's party buses. One woman was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and two other people were injured by broken glass, the Miami Herald reports.",

The researchers took DNA from skin cells from two men, aged 35 and 75, and injected it into unfertilized eggs whose DNA had been removed, NBC News explains. They then zapped the eggs with electricity to coax them into dividing until they became early-stage embryos, which were then used to make embryonic stem cells—with DNA identical to the donors. In theory, the technique could be used to produce tissue perfectly suited to patients. The technique has been carried out successfully once before, but using cells from infants.  If you can't do this with adult cells, it is of limited value,  a study co-author tells the Wall Street Journal, because there are more diseases the therapy can treat for adults.

        "news": "(Jul 7, 2016  1:57 PM CDT) A joint investigation by ProPublica and the New York Times presents a troubling look at how  unknown tens of thousands  of Americans have their lives ruined by false drug arrests. The problem stems from a $2 drug-test kit used by police departments around the country. They've been around for more than 40 years and haven't changed much in their simplicity: A police officer drops a suspected sample of a drug into a vial of liquid, and if the liquid turns the wrong color, the arrest is made. The story details the many ways the field tests can go wrong, so much so that they're generally inadmissible in court. The problem, though, is that the vast majority of such arrests never end up at trial—those arrested typically plea to lesser charges to avoid the possibility of a lengthy sentence. The story uses the example of 43-year-old Amy Albritton, who took a plea deal and three weeks in jail after a field test suggested she had cocaine in her car, no matter how much she insisted to the contrary. She lost her job and her apartment, and her new felony record kept her from getting any kind of meaningful new work. Turns out, the test was a false positive, which she learned only when informed by the journalists working on this story.  Every year at least 100,000 people nationwide plead guilty to drug-possession charges that rely on field-test results as evidence,  write Ryan Gabrielson and Topher Sanders.  At that volume, even the most modest of error rates could produce thousands of wrongful convictions.  It's unclear what the standard error rate is on the kits, but follow-up testing at individual departments suggest that it's far from  modest.  Click for the full story.",

Law enforcement needs to get their s--t together on online threats,  as do social media companies, she added. Last year, Valenti told the Washington Post that if she were starting over as a feminist writer, she would probably remain anonymous. It's  not just the physical safety concerns but the emotional ramifications  of constant online abuse, she said. While Valenti's tweets received hundreds of sympathetic replies, there were also several tweets in this vein:  What makes you so special? One 'death threat'—that's it?

The buyer's offer: $10,800. Ciudad Real's Central airport, about 150 miles south of Madrid, became a symbol of the country's wasteful spending during a construction boom that ended with the financial crisis of 2008, the year the airport opened. The airport operator went bankrupt in 2012 after it failed to draw enough traffic. Chinese group Tzaneen International tabled the single bid in Friday's auction, Spanish news agency Europa Press said. The receiver had set a minimum price of $30.3 million. If no better bid is received by September, the sale will go through. Tzaneen International reportedly plans to invest up to $108 million in the airport and make it a cargo hub. The offer is for the airport infrastructure only, not adjacent land. Central has one of Europe's longest runways and was designed to handle 2.5 million passengers a year. The construction was heavily funded by the Caja Castilla La Mancha savings bank—the first of Spain's troubled savings banks to be bailed out, in 2010. Another largely unused airport and symbol of wasteful spending is Castellon, on Spain's eastern coast. It cost around $162 million and opened in 2011.",

A 2014 Bloomberg article explained some of the reasoning behind the software, which mainly related to the use of the speedier PreCheck lane and the selection of the fliers who would randomly be directed there from the regular lane. The randomness would make it tougher for would-be terrorists to identify security-screening patterns they would use for their benefit, Bloomberg explains, and help dispel the appearance of profiling.

The verdict was the latest in a string of mass death sentences that have sparked local and international condemnation. The charges are related to the bloody August 2013 ransacking of a police station in the village of Kerdassah, near Cairo. The attackers killed 15 officers, including the police chief, and mutilated some of the bodies.The assault was believed to be revenge by Morsi loyalists for the government's crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood, which Egypt has officially declared a terrorist organization. Morsi, a longtime Brotherhood official, was ousted by the military in July 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Morsi supporters staged a pair of large public sit-in protests in Cairo, which were harshly broken up by police on August 14, 2013—killing hundreds of Brotherhood cadres. The attack on the Kerdassah police station began a few hours after the Brotherhood sit-ins were cleared. Today's verdict was issued by judge Mohammed Nagi Shehata, who has developed a reputation for harsh sentences against perceived government critics. He also sentenced three al-Jazeera journalists to jail terms ranging from 7-10 years; one of those journalists, Australian Peter Greste, was released and deported yesterday, while the other two remain in prison.",

Carr  played the oldest von Trapp child, and in some ways she maintained that role in real life—guiding, cheering, supporting, and generally being there for the rest of her 'sisters' and 'brothers.'  Carr is survived by her four siblings, her two children, and four grandchildren.

A US District Court jury decided Apple had violated a 1998 patent for technology that improves processor efficiency—a patent owned by the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's licensing division—by incorporating that technology into the A7, A8, and A8X processors found in its iPhone 5, 6, and 6 Plus models. The jury also found the patent is valid, a claim Apple unsuccessfully tried to take up with the US Patent and Trademark Office before. Presiding Judge William Conley broke the trial down into three phases: liability, damages, and whether Apple had willfully violated the patent, which could lead to more penalties. Indeed, WARF had filed for triple damages because it said the patent infringement was  willful, intentional, and in conscious disregard of WARF's right,  per the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. This isn't the first time Apple has been sued for iPad/iPhone patent infringement—Boston University filed a complaint in 2013, the Verge reports—or the first time WARF has sued over this technology (Intel settled in 2009). WARF also sued Apple a second time last month over the newest A9 and A9X chips found in recently released iPhones and the iPad Pro, per Reuters. Still, a Warwick Business School professor tells CNET that  parallel developments  by different companies means competing intellectual-property claims are  inevitable  and any damages Apple pays won't  have a substantial or lasting impact on its earnings.

At some point,  She apparently knew that the baby had died and that she would need an operation,  but she was scared of surgery and fled the hospital, instead opting to get treatment for her abdominal pain at a small clinic, her doctor says, according to the Daily Mail. When the pain came back decades later, however, she allowed doctors to remove the skeleton, which was inside a calcified sac, from her abdomen.  We found a lump on the lower right side of her abdomen, and feared it was cancer. A CT scan then revealed that the lump was made of hard, calcified matter,  one of the doctors says.  But it was only after the patient underwent an MRI that we could make out that the mass was in fact a child's skeleton. The amniotic fluid that protects the fetus might have been absorbed and the soft tissues liquefied over time with only a bag of bones with some fluid remaining.

It all started when Joe Lentini, while at a business dinner at Bobby Flay Steak at the Borgata hotel and casino last week, decided to split a bottle of wine with two others in the party of 10. The host of the dinner, who was paying the bill, told Lentini to choose.

Every possible service and every possible flavor you could think of was being made for sale,  Raj Samani at Intel Security tells Tech Insider. According to McAfee, some Netflix accounts were being sold for as low as 50 cents, while accounts for premium sports streaming services top the list at $15. Not only are these prices incredibly low, but many sellers are offering a lifetime guarantee, Tech Insider reports. That means if the account you bought for a buck gets shut down, the seller will simply give you another one. According to McAfee, this illicit marketplace isn't just bad news for the streaming services themselves; it can have repercussions for the actual account holders, too. Your account could be closed because of something the Dark Web buyer does, or the buyer could make purchases using your stored credit card information.

A team of scientists that once laid out nine  planetary boundaries  that should not be crossed says humans have managed to cross four of them already, reports Reuters. The bad grades come in the categories of rapid species loss, deforestation, the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and the amount of nitrogen and phosphorous (think fertilizer) flowing into oceans. We're still OK on ozone depletion, ocean acidification, freshwater use, microscopic particles in the atmosphere, and chemical pollution, write the 18 international researchers in Science. But they warn that the long-term trend—going back to 1950 and the start of rapid economic growth around the world—doesn't bode well.  For the first time in human history, we need to relate to the risk of destabilizing the entire planet,  says one of the authors. Bottom line? Lead author Will Steffen tells the Washington Post that at our current pace, the  Earth System  could unravel in anywhere from  decades out to a century.  The researchers concede their boundaries are squishy, and the Post illustrates an example involving carbon dioxide levels: The boundary we weren't supposed to cross was 350 parts per million. But we're now well past that and into a  zone of uncertainty  that extends to 450ppm. And after that?  The unknown—planetary conditions unfamiliar to us.

Now, thousands of people might have to pay back their share. The Federal Emergency Management Agency is scrutinizing about 4,500 households that it suspects received improper payments after the storm, according to program officials and data obtained by the AP through a public records request. As of early this month, FEMA had asked around 850 of those households to return a collective $5.8 million; the other cases were still under review. FEMA's campaign to recover overpayments typically involves inadvertent violations of eligibility rules, bureaucratic mistakes, or missing documentation rather than outright fraud. Many people asked to return money were deemed ineligible because their damaged properties were vacation houses or rental properties, not their primary residences. Others had double-dipped into the aid pool, with more than one household member getting payments. Some received FEMA money for things later covered by insurance. As of July 30, the average demanded refund was $6,987, a sum that could be difficult for many, given the modest annual incomes of most aid applicants. Roughly half of the households under scrutiny reported an annual gross income of $30,000 or less.  For most people, the money is long gone and long ago spent on storm recovery,  says the director of the New York Legal Assistance Group's Storm Response Unit, which has been helping about a dozen families fight a FEMA clawback.",

The feat spawned legends stretching over two centuries, but a new study offers the best clues yet as to how they managed it. Research began in 2012 when a survey uncovered Russian axes at a spot believed to be the survivor camp. Further searches revealed more tools archaeologists say Neva's crew members, who had set out from a Siberian port, used to survive.  The items left behind by survivors provide a unique snapshot-in-time for January 1813, and might help us to understand the adaptations that allowed them to await rescue in a frigid, unfamiliar environment for almost a month,  the lead researcher says in a release. Based on artifacts—including sheet copper, iron and copper spikes, a copper fishhook, gun flints used to start fires, musket balls carved to fit a smaller caliber firearm, and perhaps part of a navigator's dividers—archaeologists believe crew members gathered ship materials that washed ashore near their destination of Sitka, where survivors were eventually taken; only two who survived the wreck died during the month-long effort.  Collectively, the artifacts reflect improvisation in a survival situation, and do not include ceramics, glass and other materials that would be associated with a settlement,  the researcher says. Archaeologists add preserved food heaps, still to be examined, will likely reveal the sailors' foraging strategies. Until further studies can be carried out, experts plan to review oral histories of the local Tlingit people for further insight. (This man survived two days in an underwater shipwreck.)",

But now, thanks to a new study in Science, the answer is 1 trillion, give or take. Researchers had long assumed that the first number, based on relatively rudimentary tests in the 1920s, was way off the mark, and the new study is the first significant one to apply modern methods to revise it, reports Nature. The 1 trillion figure is seen as an average, with some people able to detect as  few  as 80 million odors and others able to pick up on a mind-boggling  thousand trillion  of them, according to the scientists' extrapolations.  Ten thousand is kind of pathetic—it’s a pretty low number,  says molecular neurobiologist Leslie Voshall of the Rockefeller University, a co-author of the study.  It led to the idea that humans have a comparatively low sense of smell.  For their experiment, the scientists used  a procedure similar to a hearing exam, in which listeners must try to distinguish between two tones,  explains the Washington Post. Researchers combined 128 different odor molecules to create composite scents of varying complexity, then ran them by 26 test subjects. Participants got three vials—two had identical odors and the third was slightly different—and had to pick the odd one out, reports NPR. The analysis gets more complicated than that, but after hundreds of experiments on each subject, researchers extrapolated the results to arrive at the 1 trillion average. The study is being well received in the field.  Their work confirms that smell is an incredibly rich, variable, and nuanced medium,  says one olfactory scientist not involved with the research.

The blast badly damaged the mosque in Jamrud, a town near the Afghan border in an area beset by Taliban attacks as well as vicious feuds between rival tribes and militant groups. About 250 people were attending prayers when the bomber struck, an official said. Rescuers have pulled 48 bodies from the rubble, he said, predicting the toll would likely rise further. Another 80 people are said to be injured. Television footage showed scores of residents and police digging frantically through the ruins of the white-walled mosque, whose roof appeared to have caved in. Jamrud lies in the semiautonomous Khyber tribal region, where militants have intensified attacks on trucks carrying supplies to NATO and US forces in Afghanistan.",

FOX 5, citing a release from the San Diego County Health and Human Services Agency, reports all four children, said to be between the ages of 2 and 13, contracted E. coli infections after going to the fair. While a definitive source is being investigated, it's said that the children, who visited the fair between June 8 and June 15, all had contact with animals at the fair, either at the event's petting zoo or in other animal areas.  No contamination has to do with food service or food at all. That's been verified,  Timothy Fennell, CEO of the Del Mar Fairgrounds, said at a Friday evening presser, per NBC News. One of the affected children, a 2-year-old boy, was hospitalized and died on Monday. The other three children didn't have to be hospitalized. All four started exhibiting symptoms between June 10 and June 16. CNN notes that symptoms of an E. coli infection can include diarrhea, stomach cramps, and vomiting. The SD HHSA says that anyone exhibiting any of these symptoms on or after June 8 should contact a health care provider. The fair, which continues through Thursday, notes on its site that  in the interest of public safety, activities involving direct animal interaction at the Fair have been suspended. All guests are encouraged to wash their hands after any contact with animals or their living area, as well as prior to eating or drinking.",

Promise women—and their significant others—a device that allows them to have sex during their periods without worrying about blood. Mashable reports the Flex Company received that amount in funding this month. The San Francisco-based startup, which calls its FLEX menstrual disc the anti-tampon, has been accepting orders online since April, reports the Telegraph. TechCrunch reports Flex has received orders for 250 million of its menstrual discs since then—and 20% of its customers have been men. Flex plans to start shipping menstrual discs in September. An Aug. 4 Medium post from founder Lauren Schulte explains FLEX is exclusively sold online, in a one-off eight-pack or via a monthly or quarterly subscription. FLEX is a single-use menstrual cup that can be worn for up to 12 hours without the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome. It's also hypoallergenic and latex-free, and can help  alleviate cramps.  Because the discs collect menstrual fluid while being worn next to the cervix instead of in the vaginal canal, Flex says they can be worn during intercourse for  mess-free period sex.   Women spend almost a quarter of their lives menstruating, and if we can help make women feel even slightly less ashamed about her body during this time, we’ve accomplished our mission,  Flex explains. Schulte explains the impetus for the company was her own experience, which included persistent yeast infections.  It wasn’t until a nurse practitioner mentioned that my cotton tampons could be to blame that I even considered the menstrual products I was using to be both impractical and harmful.

George Kirby, 103, and Doreen Luckie, 91, are the world’s oldest married couple, according to AFP. The newlyweds have been together (and living together) for 27 years, and have a slew of children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren between them. In regards to why they waited so long to marry, Luckie said they just  didn’t want to bother.  That changed when Kirby popped the question on Valentine's Day—albeit in a nontraditional way.  I didn't get down on one knee, because I don't think I would have been able to get back up,  he explained. The pair married at a hotel in Eastbourne, on the southern English coast, and a Guinness Book of World Records guest was in attendance, reports the Independent. The happy couple were a combined 194 years and 281 days old on their wedding day—three years older than the previous  world’s oldest couple,  Francois Fernandez and Madeleine Francineau of France. The Brits met in 1988 through a group that organizes senior friendships, and hit it off right away. Kirby was a recently divorced 76-year-old, and Luckie had been widowed three years prior. As for whether any wild pre-wedding partying occurred, Kirby's 63-year-old son had this to say:  Dad missed his stag do lunch because he wasn't feeling up for it, but Doreen had a hen party luncheon which was a complete laugh with all her golden girls.

Stephen Dennis, 49, has agreed to plead guilty and pay Brink's back for the money he's accused of stealing from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta while he was working in the armored transport service's Birmingham branch (Brink's has already paid the bank back), NBC News reports. Per a Justice Department press release, Dennis allegedly entered Brink's on a day he wasn't scheduled to work in February 2014, took four of the empty ballistic bags in which quarters are stored (each bag holds $50,000 in quarters), and filled them mostly with beads, as well as with just enough quarters so the coins could be seen in a see-through window on each bag. He's then said to have put the four bags in the coin room and, at some point, stolen 784,000 quarters—about 10,000 pounds' worth, or the weight of a large hippo, per AL.com—worth $196,000. An audit in April of that year found the bags only contained $1,000 each in real currency.  What Mr. Dennis may have thought was a nickel and dime theft was, in the end, the equivalent of a major bank heist,  the FBI agent in charge of the case says in the release.  Now, he will be a convicted felon who must repay all the stolen money.  The US attorney for the Northern District of Alabama piles it on with coined phrases, adding,  This defendant may have thought he had quite a haul … but now he carries a heavier load.  That load would normally include the maximum penalty for bank theft, which is 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine, though it's still unclear how Dennis' plea deal will affect his punishment.

The 30-year-old homesteader says he woke up in the middle of the night on Dec. 17 or 18 to find the cabin on fire. He grabbed some coats and blankets and fled outside before it became an inferno, and was heartbroken to find out that his 6-year-old chocolate lab hadn't left when he yelled at him to get out. Steele spent the next two nights in a snow cave and then built a makeshift shelter over the ruins of his cabin, where he spent 22 or 23 days in subzero temperatures and deep snow before he was rescued by an aircrew with Alaska State Troopers on Thursday, NBC reports. The only way in or out of the remote corner of the Susitna Valley was by plane, authorities say. Steele's nearest neighbor was more than 20 miles away. Steele, who had been living in the cabin since September, had no snowmobile or working phone. He says he managed to scavenge enough cans of food from the wreckage to survive—but much of it tasted like burnt plastic. He made a large  SOS  sign, though Alaska State Troopers spokesman Ken Marsh tells the New York Times that he was only found after friends and family requested a welfare check.

Dewani hired two gunmen through his driver and withdrew money from a bank account shortly before his wife's murder to pay them, according to prosecutors. Dewani's lawyers are claiming South African officials are seeking to extradite him for his wife's murder because they don't want tourists to view the nation as a dangerous place to visit—and that his wife was the victim of carjackers.

He has arthritis and a Pacemaker and uses a cane; he's served on a number of boards in the community; he used to work at a local paper plant; and he told his wife, Gennell Eubanks, that he once killed a man in  the accident that happened  decades ago—but said he never meant for it to happen, she tells the AP. Yesterday, federal agents arrested Miller on 33-year-old murder charges after tracking him to Mineola, and Miller was quick to confess. They say Miller shot a man in the head in a parking lot outside a hotel in Harrisburg, Pa., in 1981. The victim, Thomas Waller, was found dead inside his car. Miller was charged with murder and three other felonies, but fled the state. Investigators got a tip that he had been living in Mexico under the name of his deceased cousin, and used that information to trace him to Texas. Miller's wife says her husband claimed he was trying to help his brother during a fight when Waller was killed, and that his relatives in Pennsylvania  didn't want him to come back. They told him to leave.  Oddly, Miller also pleaded guilty in a 1959 murder, but his life sentence was commuted in 1971 after he had served more than 11 years, the Patriot-News reports.

President Obama has called for an increase in the tipped minimum, and things could change if Congress takes action on legislation this year. A bill introduced last month would boost the figure to $3 and eventually to 70% of the full minimum wage, which itself would rise to $10.10 by 2015.

That may be too much of a good thing, because you're more likely to suffer a stroke, according to a study out of the University of Cambridge. Researchers analyzed the sleep patterns of nearly 10,000 people ages 42 to 81 in the UK, and they report in the journal Neurology that based on nearly a decade of follow-up and 346 reported strokes, older adults who sleep more than eight hours a night are 46% more likely to suffer a stroke than adults who slept six to eight hours. That risk is actually four times greater when people went from sleeping for less than six hours at the beginning of the study to more than 8 as the years passed, per a Eureka Alert press release. The researchers adjusted for several factors, including age and sex, and their findings were strikingly consistent with what they found in a review of the combined data of 11 similar studies spanning 560,000 people in seven countries. But in terms of age and sex, the Los Angeles Times notes the following: The link between the risk and sleep length was a little stronger for women, and the increased stroke risk was only seen in those eight-plus-hours sleepers who were 63 or older. The researchers caution that it remains unclear whether longer sleep duration is a symptom or cause of stroke risk.

And the lawmakers aren't blind to potential conflicts of interest: They check in with ethics committee lawyers thousands of times per year. From 2007 to 2011, those lawyers offered some 2,800 opinions on such matters, making 40,000 phone calls in the process. But these communications rarely seek to dissuade legislators from their goals; in fact, they typically help justify the efforts. Lawmakers argue that they're fighting for the greater good, which in some cases matches their own interests. And indeed, ethics rules seem to support that argument, offering exemptions to a financial conflict-of-interest rule. For instance,  if a dairy farmer represented a dairy farming state in the Senate... he would not fall under the strictures of this rule,  says the Senate ethics manual. But it's time to tighten such rules, experts tell the Post. They  should not require the public or the media to go digging around to make the connections,  notes a public policy professor.",

If the answer is C, you may be an employee of the Kobe waterworks bureau. A 64-year-old waterworks employee in the Japanese city was reprimanded and docked half a day's pay after officials discovered that he had left his desk three minutes before the start of his lunch break to buy a bento box for lunch, the Guardian reports. Officials bowed during the press conference, apologizing for the  deeply regrettable  conduct, which happened 26 times over seven months, adding up to 78 minutes of lost work. Critics on social media called the punishment harsh and ridiculed the bureau's apology, with some pointing out that officials had wasted more time on the press conference than the worker had on early lunches. Others noted that it came soon after Japan's parliament passed measures intended to prevent death from overwork.  We have received opinion this time from both directions, such as the reprimand was too much,  waterworks bureau spokesman Gen Oka tells CNN.  We must think again  about what are  the appropriate measures to take.  He adds, however, that the bureau is  bound to the public servant duty to spend the working hours for our duty.

Twenty-nine months he suffered,  said Hussing's sister at yesterday's sentencing hearing.  Twenty-nine months they had to do something and they chose not to.

Yesterday his parents were sentenced to eight years in prison, the AP reports. In the days before his death, as his mother treated him with cold medicine, Willie had begged to be taken to a doctor, prosecutors said, adding that at least eight family members confronted the couple about their son's health. Attorneys for Hussing, 37, and Robinson, 40, say the couple had financial difficulties and couldn't afford medical care, but Hussing's sister said that the real reason for the neglect was that Hussing stayed in bed all day and did drugs. Willie and his three siblings were also not enrolled in school. The judge who accepted Hussing's and Robinson's guilty pleas to attempted involuntary manslaughter gave them the maximum sentence, comparing Willie's emaciated body in his autopsy photo to the bodies of concentration camp victims.

The pope has sent a strong message to his Left Coast faithful by naming a key backer of Proposition 8 against gay marriage as the new archbishop of San Francisco. Salvatore Cordileone, who officially takes charge next week, is considered an  architect  of Proposition 8, notes the Los Angeles Times. He helped develop the proposition to shoot down the state's gay marriage measure when he was an auxiliary bishop in San Diego. Cordileone's appointment by Pope Benedict  re-emphasizes the Vatican's concern about gay marriage  even in a city like San Francisco, Father Thomas J. Reese, a senior fellow at Georgetown University, tells the Times.  They're serious, and they're not going to back down.  Cordileone, who heads the  defense of marriage  subcommittee for the US Conference of Bishops, has warned that Catholics have to understand the  church is not going to change its teaching,  and has said that the sacrament of Communion should be denied to gays and lesbians in a relationship.  Paranoia is very high,  says San Francisco Supervisor Scott Wiener, whose district includes Most Holy Redeemer Church in the Castro, which could be the largest gay Catholic congregation in the nation.  There are a lot of gay people for whom this religion is very important. It's just very, very sad,  he tells the San Francisco Chronicle.

According to Curbed New York, the Hallett Nature Sanctuary—originally known as the Promontory—is adjacent to the Pond in the southeast corner of the park. It was closed to the public in the 1930s by a parks commissioner who wanted to turn it into a bird sanctuary. Unfortunately, the fenced-off area was promptly overrun by invasive plant species. Workers started restoring it in 2001 as part of a $40 million Central Park Conservancy revitalization project. Among other things, workers installed a gate, built pathways, and replaced invasive plants with native species. Now, the Central Park Conservancy calls the Hallett sanctuary—one of only three woodland areas in the park— a peaceful haven just feet away from some of Central Park's busiest paths.  The organization says the work done on the area has made it  more diverse and healthy than ever.  The sanctuary will be open to the public for a few hours three to four days a week through the end of August. (Some visionaries want to add a  skyscraper  to the park.)",

A man able to run at this speed would cross the finish line of 100 meters as Bolt dawdled at the 60-meter mark, the Telegraph reports. The calculation is based on an assessment of how quickly the muscle fibers themselves can contract. Scientists had thought the limiting factor in human speed was the amount of force the limbs could take striking the ground, but the researchers from the University of Wyoming say their work shows it's the  speed limit  on the muscles that are key.

He enlisted in the army on Oct. 6, 1942, less than a year after the US entered the war, and served as a private during the September 1943 Allied invasion of Italy. He also did a tour in North Africa and spent most of his post-military life in the cement finishing business after an honorable discharge in 1945, the AP reports.  I can remember the day I was inducted in the Army until the day I was discharged,  he told KPLC in November last year.  I've been through so many dangerous things and I'm still here. I'm thankful to the almighty God for it. That's all I can say.  He never married or had children, but a nephew says he took pride in looking after his six siblings' children. In December last year, Levingston was part of a group of veterans who traveled to Washington, DC, for a ceremony marking the Dec. 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor. Ahead of the trip, Levingston was honored at a ceremony. District Attorney John DeRosier, speaking at the ceremony, said when he looked at Levingston, he didn't see a 110-year-old man.  I see a young black soldier in green utilities with worn combat boots, scampering across the sand on those beaches,  he said.

Abbott, who runs the nonprofit Love Thy Neighbor and has been feeding the homeless for more than 20 years, had served up just a handful of meals in Stranahan Park when he was stopped, the Sun-Sentinel reports.

Gary Herbert signed into law a bill requiring anesthesia for patients who reach this mark, USA Today reports. The  Protecting Unborn Children  mandate is the first of its kind to pass in the US, rekindling a debate as to whether a fetus can feel pain at that point in the gestational cycle. (The Washington Post notes a review of more than 300 studies shows the fetus likely doesn't perceive pain before 28 weeks.) The governor  believes in not only erring on the side of life, but also minimizing any pain that may be caused to an unborn child,  a spokesman for Herbert said in a statement. The law wouldn't apply in cases where anesthesia could hurt the mother, if the abortion was needed to save the mother's life, or if the fetus suffered from a congenital defect that would prove fatal, per the AP and USA Today. Other states have tried for similar laws and failed; a dozen states ban abortion after between 20 and 22 weeks, while others offer the option of anesthesia. Critics note the law could be applied in cases where labor is induced, such as with pre-eclampsia or when a woman's due date has passed. State Sen. Curt Bramble, who sponsored the bill, argues anesthesia is used in other situations in Utah, such as for convicts put to death and animals being put down, so this law simply maintains consistency.

Utah Highway Patrol trooper Rick Morgan noticed a car swerving so badly on Interstate 15 in Ogden that he expected to find a person needing medical attention, per CBS News. Instead, he found a 5-year-old boy named Adrian, perched on the edge of the driver's seat so his feet could reach the pedals.  How does a little 5-year-old, 11 years younger than me, do it and I can't?  Adrian's sister Sidney Estrada tells KUTV. She was watching her younger siblings when she fell asleep. When she woke up, she noticed three things were missing: Adrian, the family's SUV, and the keys. Adrian had made it 2 miles when Morgan spotted the Dodge Journey. The boy ignored the flashing lights but pulled over soon after hearing a siren.  Where did you come from? How did you get this car?  said a baffled Morgan, who helped Adrian get the vehicle into park. Adrian announced he'd argued with his mom, who refused to buy him a Lamborghini, and planned to drive to California to buy one himself—with all of $3 he proudly displayed in his wallet.  I don't know what went through his mind,  says Sidney. Adrian's parents, who collected their son and vehicle, told troopers that the boy had never driven before. But  the police told me I drive good,  Adrian tells KUTV. In fact, Morgan tells the AP,  it seemed a little worse than a normal impaired driver.",

Paul Whelan, 50, insists he's innocent and was set up in a bogus sting operation, reports the BBC. On Monday, he held a sign in court reading  sham trial!  Whelan was arrested in December 2018 in a hotel room in Moscow with what prosecutors say was a flash drive filled with classified information. Whelan's explanation: A Russian friend gave him what he thought was a drive filled with family photos. Whelan holds passports for the US, Britain, Canada, and Ireland, and he works as director of global security for US automotive parts supplier BorgWarner, the company tells NPR.  This secret trial in which no evidence was produced is an egregious violation of human rights and international legal norms,  said a spokesman for the US embassy in Moscow. US ambassador John Sullivan called it a  mockery of justice  and warned that it would hurt US-Russian relations. A Reuters report suggests that Whelan might be part of a prisoner swap for a Russian national jailed in the US. Details were scarce, but Moscow has been pushing for the release of two men in particular, Viktor Bout, convicted of arms dealing, and Konstantin Yaroshenko, convicted of cocaine smuggling. (Whelan previously complained about abusive conditions in prison.)",

The rapid fall centers around $4.5 billion missing from a state development fund overseen by Najib before his election loss to Mahathir Mohamad last week, reports the Wall Street Journal. Though Najib was cleared of wrongdoing while in office, the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission has reopened the investigation based on claims he intervened to hide his pocketing of $681 million from fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), some of which he allegedly spent on shopping sprees for his wife. During recent raids at his properties, police say they seized 284 boxes of handbags from Gucci, Chanel, and Hermes; 72 suitcases holding jewelry and Rolex watches; and at least $157,000 in cash. Najib's lawyer says the investigation represents  unwarranted harassment,  per the BBC. But Malaysia is only one of six countries investing the fund.

A lady from London wrote and said, 'Hundred-and-three-year-old chocolate is not so special,'  auctioneer Paul Cooper tells the Daily Express. That's because that woman had in her possession something even better: a tin of chocolates made in 1900, one of the gifts Queen Victoria had commissioned for soldiers fighting overseas in the Boer War to boost morale, the BBC reports. The red, gold, and blue container, made by Hudson Scott and Sons in Carlisle, was designed with  rounded corners for ease of storage in a soldier's knapsack  and to hold 8 ounces of vanilla chocolate, per the National Army Museum. That confection, the auction house tells the BBC, was  probably the most controversial chocolate ever made.  That's because the three main chocolate-makers in the UK at the time—JS Fry, Rowntree, and Cadbury—were helmed by pacifist Quakers who didn't want to be seen as making money from the war. They didn't want to spurn the queen, however, so their compromise was to donate the chocolate for free, as well as brand the chocolate with their company names (the queen wanted soldiers to know they were getting the best), but not the tins. As for how the unnamed woman came to have this 118-year-old tin, she says it's been sitting for a long time in a cupboard drawer and thinks it came from her late husband's family. A Nestle archivist tells the Express the chocolate inside is  probably not in as bad a condition as you might think, but I wouldn't recommend eating it.  The Yorkshire Post reports the tin, which will go up for auction Tuesday, could fetch up to $400. (This more modern chocolate is pink.)",

A doctor at a Dhusamareb hospital tells Voice of America the child was brought to the ER early last week, two days after her parents say she'd had the procedure, but despite the response team's efforts to save the girl, she bled to death. She also got tetanus because the instruments used during the procedure weren't sterilized, Dr. Abdirahman Omar Hassan says.  They cut the clitoris, one side of the vulva was cut, the other side was wounded in three areas,  Hassan noted.  I never saw anyone who was mutilated like that in my life.  Hawa Aden Mohamed, a social activist and head of a local women's rights group, tells Reuters it's believed the person who carried out the mutilation  cut an important vein in the course of the operation.  The girl's father, meanwhile, says he's  distraught  but doesn't blame anyone for her death (he says she was  taken by Allah ) and stands behind the practice.  The people in the area are content with it, her mother consented to it,  Dahir Nur says.  We have seen the effects, but it's a culture in the country we live in.  The practice—which involves partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia—is prohibited in Somalia's constitution, but there's nothing on the books actually outlawing it, the BBC notes. Politicians have been wary of criminalizing it for fear of infuriating locals who consider it a religious ritual.  The woman who performed the operation has not been arrested, but even if she was, there is no law that would ensure she is punished,  Mohamed tells Reuters.  This is just one among many cases happening on a daily basis across Somalia.  (A Michigan doctor was accused of mutilating 100 girls.)",

All six were detained as suspected militants with ties to al-Qaeda in 2002 but were never charged. They have been cleared for release since at least 2010 but languished as the US struggled to find countries willing to accept them. Mujica had agreed to take the men in January. Obama administration officials have been frustrated that the transfer took so long and blame outgoing Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel for not approving the move sooner. They said the deal sat for months on Hagel's desk, awaiting his signature as required by law. The US has released 19 prisoners so far this year. Officials say several more are expected by the end of the year.",

Per ABC News, Wickham and three friends, who are all black, arrived at Hong Shing Chinese Restaurant to celebrate his birthday on May 3, 2014. However, once they were seated, their server said they'd need to pay for their meal first, and when they questioned why, they were told it was restaurant policy. Wickham—who immigrated from Trinidad when he was 20 and says he's not used to racial profiling—was suspicious, however. After confirming with other patrons that they hadn't had to prepay, he confronted staff, who admitted his table was the only one asked to prepay, per Newsweek. They were offered and accepted a refund. A year later Wickham filed his complaint with the Ontario tribunal, which ruled April 18 the restaurant treated him like a  potential thief in waiting.   At that moment it hurt to be black,  the case's adjudicator wrote. In its response, the restaurant said it had experienced customers who  dine and dash  and so had started asking non-regulars to pay first. One of the men who was with Wickham, however, said he'd dined at Hong Shing about 20 times before the incident, the Washington Post notes. Hong Shing staff says the restaurant has since changed management; a business license search by the Globe & Mail shows the director as Colin Li, the son of the couple who opened the restaurant in 1997.

The airline brought 88 used foreign jets into its fleet between 2013 and 2017, and last year an FAA official uncovered abnormalities with the paperwork. Southwest has since informed the FAA that for some of the planes, it has struggled to find reliable paperwork indicating that necessary repairs and maintenance were carried out by previous operators, but that Southwest considers it  more of a record-keeping problem than a safety risk,  per the Journal. Ultimately the FAA allowed the planes to continue flying as long as Southwest sped up inspections and finished them by the end of January. CNN notes the issue was brought to light after a Senate panel released paperwork Monday. Of the 88 jets in question, 41 have been inspected and deemed compliant and nine are undergoing inspections. A veteran maintenance inspector first expressed concern about the remaining 38 planes last year, and more inspectors continued to complain to FAA managers this year that paperwork was missing. By Oct. 29, the FAA was threatening to ground the planes, all of which are Boeing 737s. Discussions between the FAA and Southwest then ensued, and the Jan. 31 deadline was agreed upon.

The woman, who developed symptoms a few days after returning to the US last week, is doing well but is being kept in isolation in a hospital as a precaution, per CNBC, which reports she had  very limited movement from outside her home and did not use public transportation or attend any large gatherings.  Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, says the  CDC believes the immediate risk to the US public is low at this time, but the situation is evolving rapidly  and more cases are likely. Some 63 people in 22 states are being monitored for potential cases of the virus that has killed at least 26 people and infected 830 overseas, per the New York Times.

CNN reports that the 34-year-old software engineer pleaded guilty in federal court Monday to using the access he used to have at Yahoo to hack into some 6,000 accounts and snoop through users' private data. What Ruiz was mainly on the hunt for, per a Justice Department statement:  primarily sexual images and videos of the account holders.  Ruiz is said to have figured out user passwords to target the accounts of young women, including those of co-workers and friends outside of work.  Once he had access to the Yahoo accounts, Ruiz admitted to compromising the iCloud, Facebook, Gmail, (Dropbox), and other online accounts of the Yahoo users in search of more private images and videos,  the statement notes. Authorities say he then stored that stolen imagery and footage at home—until Yahoo suspected something was up, and Ruiz subsequently destroyed the computer and hard drive where he kept the data. Ruiz, who pleaded guilty to one count of computer intrusion, is set to be sentenced in February. He could receive up to five years in prison, plus have to pay a $250,000 fine and restitution.

He now hopes a federal appeals court ruling will point him in the right direction. The 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday that grand jury transcripts, usually kept secret, could be unsealed in the case. They relate to the July 25 killings of Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey, reports the AP. Victim Roger Malcolm, 24, had just been bailed out of jail, where he was held for stabbing a white man he suspected of sleeping with his wife, when a white mob of 20 to 25 people stopped the group on Moore's Ford Bridge in rural Walton County. The mob did not hurt the white driver—who happened to be a former KKK member—but the two black couples were shot on the banks of the Apalachee River. The FBI identified numerous possible suspects—including relatives of the man Malcom had stabbed—but a grand jury opted not to indict anyone. In a dissenting opinion in the new ruling, Judge James Graham said he worried the transcripts would tarnish the reputations of innocent people, reports NJ.com. However, Judge Charles Wilson cited  exceptional circumstances  to overrule grand jury secrecy.  There is no indication that any witnesses, suspects, or their immediate family members are alive to be intimidated, persecuted, or arrested,  he wrote in the majority opinion.  Perhaps now the truth of this unfortunate, gruesome act will be finally unearthed and displayed to the world,  Pitch's lawyer tells the AP.

In one recent case, an ambulance carrying a man with a fever and difficulty breathing was rejected by 80 hospitals and forced to search for hours for a hospital in downtown Tokyo that would treat him, per the AP. Another feverish man finally reached a hospital after paramedics unsuccessfully contacted 40 clinics. The Japanese Association for Acute Medicine and the Japanese Society for Emergency Medicine say many hospital ERs are refusing to treat people, including those suffering strokes, heart attacks, and external injuries. Japan initially seemed to have controlled the outbreak by going after clusters of infections in specific places, usually enclosed spaces such as clubs, gyms, and meeting venues. But the spread of virus outpaced this approach, and most new cases are untraceable. The outbreak has highlighted underlying weaknesses in medical care in Japan, which has long been praised for its high-quality insurance system and reasonable costs.

I don’t remember what I did at the crime ... because I wasn’t there, apparently.  The Beatrice Six are a unique case in the history of American crime, and the New Yorker takes a long look at their harrowing experience. The six were convicted of raping and killing Helen Wilson in 1985 despite not matching blood and semen found at the scene. Even after a judge in 2009 found they were innocent  beyond all doubt,  many of the six still have vivid memories of committing the crime. Some still don't seem convinced of their own innocence; they can feel the pillow they believe they used to smother Wilson and remember who else was in her apartment when they did it. Psychiatrist Eli Chesen says the Beatrice Six suffered Stockholm syndrome at the hands of a local psychiatrist named Wayne Price. A number of the Beatrice Six had been treated by Price before becoming suspects in the crime. They had histories of abuse, mental health issues, and more.  We were all broken in one way, shape, or form,  says one. A pig farmer-turned-sheriff's detective obsessed with the case started fingering people on the fringes of Nebraska society as guilty, and Price convinced the already suggestible suspects of that guilt, insisting their dreams were real memories of the crime.

Piala Inc., a Tokyo-based marketing firm, introduced a policy last month granting six extra paid holidays per year to non-smoking employees to make up for the cigarette breaks of employees who do smoke. It all started when a non-smoker used the company suggestion box to complain about smoking breaks, a spokesperson tells the Telegraph.  Our CEO saw the comment and agreed, so we are giving non-smokers some extra time off to compensate,  the spokesperson explains. Smoke breaks are particularly time-consuming at the company—about 15 minutes each—because smokers must travel from the office on the 29th floor to the basement. So far, 25% of the employees have taken days off under the new policy—and, at least according to the spokesperson, four people have quit smoking as a result of the policy. Kyodo News says in Japan, where 21.7% of adults are estimated to smoke, more companies are starting to attempt to rein in the practice, with one company going so far as to ban smoking during work hours.

The company notes that experts have tied lung injuries and deaths to vaping products and called this a  public health crisis and a youth epidemic.  Apple concurs, and so has nixed all current vaping-related apps and updated its App Store guidelines so future ones will be rejected. The company never hosted apps that actually sold vape cartridges, but it did make accessory apps available for download that allowed people to control the lighting and temperature of their vaping devices, as well as apps that offered vaping-themed news and games. The move comes a day after the Centers for Disease Control issued its latest update on the matter, reporting that 42 people have died in 24 states and the District of Columbia from vaping-related illnesses.

Now educators in Oklahoma and Kentucky are walking out on their jobs and rallying at their respective state capitols, reports CNN. The issue, as it was in West Virginia, is money, though the particulars vary. In Kentucky, teachers are marching over the state budget and a surprise pension bill that lawmakers unexpectedly shoehorned into a sewage bill last week. In Oklahoma, the issue revolves around teacher salaries—an Oklahoma Education Association rep says teachers are looking for a $10,000 pay hike over three years—and funding for education overall. Thousands of teachers rallied in the streets of Frankfort, Ky., Monday morning, reports the AP, and educators in Oklahoma were staging a similar march, per NewsOK.  What happened in West Virginia is inspiring for sure,  a spokesperson for the Kentucky Education Association tells ABC, referencing the 5% pay raise teachers in the Mountain State effected via their walkout. Monday's protest comes just days after Arizona teachers held their own demonstration in Phoenix, demanding a 20% pay raise, per USA Today. A KFOR article underscores the plight of some teachers in Oklahoma, where some say they're forced to work multiple jobs in addition to their teaching gigs to make ends meet.

At least you're not alone: A new survey finds that 42% of Americans have under $10,000 saved up for later years and will likely retire broke, CBS New York reports. The 2018 poll by GoBankingRates.com found that 14% of respondents and 60% of young Americans have saved nothing at all. Among the most cited reasons were  I'm struggling to pay bills,   I don't make enough money to save,  and  I'm prioritizing paying down debt.  Some ignorance of the  saving  concept may also be at work, suggests Tom Zgainer, CEO of America’s Best 401k:  The amount of people who don’t even know an individual retirement plan is available is astounding,  he says. The survey—which polled 1,000 people from millennials to baby boomers—also found that women were more likely to have less saved up for retirement. But not all news was bad: 16% have $300,000 or more saved up and 10% have between $200,000 and $300,000, Fortune reports. So what to do if you're behind?

The story started in November 2016, when Gibson's Bakery, which is across the street from the Ohio private college, suspected a black Oberlin student of shoplifting and using a fake ID. Allyn Gibson (the owners' son, per Fox News) got into an altercation with him and two other black students. The next day, more than 100 people attended a student-organized protest outside the bakery, chanting things like  Gibson's is racist  and handing out pamphlets encouraging people to boycott the bakery and claiming it had a racist history. Oberlin also put a hold on business done with the bakery, per Inside Higher Ed. However, the three students were eventually arrested and admitted fault; they pleaded guilty and signed statements affirming the incident wasn't based on race. In November 2017, Gibson's sued Oberlin and its dean of students, Meredith Raimondo, accusing the school of helping to organize the protests and encouraging students to demonstrate, using university funds to buy gloves for students involved in the protest and passing a resolution, via the student government, stating that Gibson's was racist. Deans, professors, and other college staffers also took part in the protest, per CNN. On Friday, a state jury found the college had libeled the bakery owners, interfered with business relationships, and inflicted emotional distress. Oberlin had argued it shouldn't be liable for  the independent peaceful exercise of federal First Amendment rights by the institution's students and its employees,  saying after the verdict it was working  to ensure that students' freedom of speech was protected and that the student demonstrations were safe and lawful.

But there apparently has been  new information  in the case, which has led the National Park Service to triple the reward for information leading to his whereabouts to $60,000. As an NPS release explains, the 41-year-old Fugate was working a Jan. 13, 1980, shift at the southeastern Arizona monument's visitor center when he set out on one of the trails. He was never seen again. In a 1981 article on the missing man, the New York Times reported the 17-square-mile monument area was thoroughly searched, but that search didn't extend beyond those grounds. The Douglas Dispatch in 2010 reported that no items were missing from Fugate's home to suggest he actively disappeared. The Times reported that friends and family (he left behind a wife) suspected he came across a drug deal in progress—drug deals had been known to occur at the monument, which sits roughly 60 miles from the Mexican border—and that the uniform and badge he was wearing caused those he encountered to panic and abduct him.  I believe there is a 50% chance that a homicide has occurred,  an investigator with the Cochise sheriff's office said at the time. The only lead was an acquaintance's report of seeing Fugate sandwiched between two men in a pickup, though that stemmed from a quick glimpse that occurred as the vehicles passed each other at 50mph.

The rare find—actually two vases in one, with a pierced outer layer of yangcai ( foreign colors ) and an inner layer painted in traditional blue and white—was once owned by British collector Harry Garner, who sold it for the modern-day equivalent of $1,500 in 1954, according to Sotheby's. Some time later, a woman inherited the vase without knowing much about its worth—that is, until a Sotheby's expert arrived to inspect it, per Atlas Obscura. The auction house says double-walled vases like this one were only made over two years in the early 1740s, during the reign of the Qianlong Emperor. Overseen by imperial kiln supervisor Tang Ying,  the extremely small group of pierced, double-walled vases that were produced for the Qianlong Emperor provided probably the greatest technical challenge ever for the potters at the imperial kilns,  a ceramics scholar notes.  The perfection of the execution is next to miraculous.  Sotheby's says imperial records suggest the emperor considered the vase a masterwork and displayed it at the Palace of Heavenly Purity, where he hosted banquets. Before realizing its value, its most recent owner kept the foot-tall vase with Rococo-style flowers and celadon-green lattice in an open cupboard in a home with multiple cats and dogs, per Smithsonian.

I've tried to avoid doing this ever since the picture came out. When you just say the ideas they sound foolish, whereas if they’re dramatized one feels it, but I'll try,  the famed director of Dr. Strangelove and The Shining tells TV personality Jun'ichi Yaio in a phone call.  The idea was supposed to be that [the astronaut played by actor Keir Dullea] is taken in by god-like entities, creatures of pure energy and intelligence with no shape or form. They put him in what I suppose you could describe as a human zoo to study him, and his whole life passes from that point on in that room. And he has no sense of time.  After discussing the  deliberately  inaccurate French architecture of the room in the closing scene, Kubrick says that  when they get finished with him, as happens in so many myths of all cultures in the world, he is transformed into some kind of super being and sent back to Earth, transformed and made into some sort of superman. We have to only guess what happens when he goes back. It is the pattern of a great deal of mythology, and that is what we were trying to suggest.

The study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology suggests that people who follow general exercise guidelines of 2.5 to 5 hours a week of moderate activity (brisk walking, for example) or 1.25 to 2.5 hours of more vigorous activity (swimming, jogging, etc.) might decrease their chances of getting the seven cancers—colon, breast, kidney, myeloma, liver, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and endometrial, reports CNN. The possible benefits varied, from a 6% to 10% lower risk of breast cancer to an 18% to 27% lower risk of liver cancer. The research analyzed data from studies involving more than 750,000 men and women in the US, Australia, and Europe over a decade. Exercise guidelines  have largely been based on their impact on chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and diabetes,  says Alpa Patel, senior scientific director of epidemiology research at the American Cancer Society. But  these data provide strong support that these recommended levels are important to cancer prevention, as well.  Coverage notes that the research was observational, meaning it does not prove a cause-and-effect between exercise and a lower cancer risk. Still, Forbes finds it interesting that the study suggests a correlation between the amount of exercise and lower risk. For example, men who complete 7.5 MET hours (metabolic equivalents) of exercise per week saw an 8% lower risk of colon cancer, compared with a 14% lower risk for those who did 15 MET hours a week.",

(Pity Fairbanks, Alaska, which will log just 3 hours and 42 minutes.) But as far as solstices go, this one will be a little more special than most. That's because the final full moon of the year—known as the Cold Moon, or Full Cold Moon—comes on Saturday, technically at 12:49pm. CNN reports that timing means the moon will appear full tonight, so much so that  people with pretty good eyesight could read by it.  The last time the solstice and Cold Moon were less than 24 hours apart was 2010, reports Quartz, and it won't happen again until 2029. That brightness could make it somewhat tricky to see the best night of the annual Ursids meteor shower, Saturday, where viewers have a chance of seeing up to 10 meteors per hour, reports CNN.",

Thunberg recently received a $100,000 award from the Human Act, a Danish anti-poverty NGO, and now the Local reports Thunberg will donate that money to the United Nations Children's Fund to help kids who may be suffering during the pandemic.  Like the climate crisis, the coronavirus pandemic is a child-rights crisis,  Thunberg says in a release.  It will affect all children, now and in the long term, but vulnerable groups will be impacted the most.  Human Act will match her donation. The money will go toward UNICEF emergency programs that distribute such items as hygiene kits, protective gear like masks and gloves, and other health care items. Newsweek notes that although kids are less likely to experience severe physical reactions to the virus, it can still be deadly to the younger set, and children remain  among the biggest victims of the pandemic  in terms of social and economic effects. The outlet cites a recent UN report estimating between 42 million and 66 million kids could fall into extreme poverty, which could lead to hundreds of thousands of more child deaths. Other ways in which kids may suffer from the pandemic include immunization programs being temporarily nixed, as well as increased vulnerability to domestic violence as they're locked down at home.  Through her activism, Greta Thunberg has proven that young people are ready to ... lead change in the world,  says UNICEF Executive Director Henrietta Fore.",

Between the beginning of 2016 and the end of October 2017, a 60 Minutes investigation uncovered more than 100 serious mechanical incidents the airline experienced: from hydraulic leaks and air pressure loss in the cabin to rapid descents, aborted takeoffs, and more—including 60 unscheduled landings. The airline has just 99 planes, yet experienced 25 engine failures or malfunctions in two years, and its planes are three and a half times more likely than those of other carriers to experience  serious in-flight mechanical failures,  per the report. But Allegiant Air, a budget carrier based in Las Vegas, is one of the most profitable airlines in the US, even if most customers are unaware of those problems. A former member of the National Transportation Safety Board says he won't fly the airline and encourages his family and friends not to fly it, either. The aviation experts 60 Minutes spoke to during its 7-month investigation believe the problems stem from Allegiant's ultra-low-cost fares; in order to keep them so affordable, the airline must keep its own costs down—and keep its planes flying as long as possible. Almost 30% of its planes are McDonnell-Douglas MD-80s, which are old and difficult to find parts for. Those planes, nearly all of which were bought secondhand from foreign airlines, are responsible for most of the problems the investigation uncovered. Some also fault the FAA for being too lax in its oversight of the airline. Allegiant is calling the story a  false narrative,  while the AP reports shares of its parent company were down in early trading. See CBS News for more.",

Now, 11 years later, police may have their man—but they may have had him much sooner if there hadn't been a massive backlog in testing a pile of rape kits. KOMO News reports that, among the more than 1,000 kits stockpiled by the Seattle Police Department, was the one that made a DNA match to Darin Bolar at the end of last year, leading to the 52-year-old's arrest on Sept. 26. Bolar, a Level III sex offender, already had a rape conviction under his belt from 25 years ago after assaulting another 14-year-old at a theme park. In the Beacon Hill case, the suspect had first grabbed the girl and raped her in some nearby bushes, then forced a garden hose into her vagina to try to clear out any evidence of the assault, per police reports. He then allegedly took the girl back to his home, where she was beaten, raped, and made to clean his house for the next two days. She finally said to have escaped while the suspect was at work and another man slept on the couch. She was tested immediately for forensic evidence, but that kit wasn't tested until December 2017. The Seattle Post-Intelligencer notes that a $3M DOJ grant was given to the state's AG office in 2017 to help start testing the more than 6,400 untested rape kits across Washington.

Deemed the  mystery of the missing princess  by the BBC, the 32-year-old's story took a chaotic turn in March when, after what friends say was a seven-year plot to escape her  oppressive  life, Latifa was snatched from her escape yacht off of India by armed men. Latifa's sister, Shamsa, had attempted a similar escape in 2000; it's still murky what happened to her after she was apparently recaptured. The Guardian and a new BBC documentary detail Latifa's escape attempt, which reportedly began with a letter she sent in 2011 to a former French navy officer who'd escaped Dubai himself in the late '90s after some legal troubles there. A friend tells the BBC she was the one on the day of Latifa's escape who drove the princess to Oman, then helped her get to a yacht at sea via inflatable boat and Jet Ski. Days after that, the ship was raided and Latifa disappeared; her Instagram was shuttered soon after.  If you are watching this video, it's not such a good thing,  Latifa says in the recording.  Either I'm dead or I'm in a very, very, very bad situation.  In April, the Guardian quoted a source said to be close to the Dubai rulers who said Latifa had been returned home, was  with her family,  and was  doing excellent.

HBO president of programming Casey Bloys says prequel House of the Dragon is still being written, but his guess is that it will premiere  sometime in 2022.  Bloys tell Deadline that there is no casting news yet from what will be a  big, complicated show.  Bloys confirmed in October that the network had ordered the series, which is set around 300 years before the events in Game of Thrones. Other successors are in the works, but  for me for right now, I think getting House of the Dragon on the air will be the number one priority,  Bloys says.  There are no other blinking green lights or anything like that. Sometime down the road who knows, but there are no immediate plans. We are all focusing on House of the Dragon.  Bloys explained that House of the Dragon was chosen over a prequel set thousand of years earlier because there was more of a  road map,  meaning George RR Martin's 2018 book Fire and Blood, Gizmodo reports. He says the need for much more  world creation  was one of the reasons the prequel written by Jane Goldman did not become a series after the pilot episode.  I think Jane did a beautiful job, it was a big challenge but there was nothing that I would point to and say, oh, that one element did not work, just overall it did not quite gel,  he says. Bloys says that when they started to think about  life after Game of Thrones,  they  purposefully developed multiple projects  because  as you know, it takes a lot of tries to get it right.",

The court was hearing the case of Curtis Flowers, who was sentenced to death in his sixth trial for four 1996 murders in Mississippi.

The actress objected to her portrayal in the FX Networks series, saying she came off as gossipy and crude. For example, she says she would have never used the word  bitch,  as Catherine Zeta-Jones does in portraying her. Series creator Ryan Murphy, however, countered that the series' depiction of de Havilland is protected on free-speech grounds—and justices on the 2nd US District Court of Appeals in California agreed.

Murphy hailed the ruling as a victory for the arts and the First Amendment, but de Havilland's attorney already is planning an appeal, notes Variety.

In the US, about 20% of adults say they were harmed at least once in the past year due to someone else's drinking, CNN reports. The study asked about 10 different types of harm: harassment; feeling threatened or afraid; ruined belongings; vandalized property; being pushed, hit or assaulted; being physically harmed; traffic accidents; being a passenger in a vehicle with a drunk driver; family or marital problems; and financial trouble. And the true number of those experiencing secondhand harm due to alcohol is likely higher, a study author says: The study  is only limited to a snapshot in time of about a year. So probably more people have actually been harmed by someone else's drinking at other times in their life.  Per a press release, study authors believe policymakers should address this issue in the same way they address the harms of secondhand smoke. Harassment was the most prevalent type of harm reported. Beyond that, for women—21% of whom reported experiencing at least one type of harm in the prior year—family or marital problems and financial problems came in next; women were more likely than men to report harm due to the behavior of a spouse, partner, or family member. Men, conversely, were more likely than women to report harm due to a stranger's behavior. After harassment,  for men, the driving-related harms were the most common, followed by property damage and vandalism,  the study author says. The study found that those under age 25 were more likely than older adults to have experienced harm due to someone else's drinking, and a professor not involved with the study found that interesting:  People who are 18 to 25, they are showing the highest rates of alcoholism,  she tells CNN.

Since methanol is  a close chemical cousin of potable alcohol  and also makes people feel intoxicated, it is  sometimes used by bootleggers to cheaply pad out liquor,  as LiveScience explained in 2012. But methanol, which is used in solvents and antifreeze, is metabolized differently than ethanol and can kill people in the same way typical alcohol poisoning does—except that it can do so after just a few ounces are ingested.

As NPR notes, supplemental unemployment benefits of $600 per week that Congress approved four months ago for tens of millions of Americans are about to expire, and lawmakers will have to decide whether to extend them. Another big decision: whether Americans will receive a second stimulus check. Much is up in the air on that, including how much it would be and who would qualify this time around, reports CNET. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said lawmakers will be  looking at another direct payment,  though he said the focus should be on those making less than $40,000, per MassLive. Also on the line: whether to extend federal eviction protections, set to expire at the end of July, reports Politico. Republicans are considering an overall package of about $1 trillion, but Democrats want more, per the Hill. Both McConnell and Nancy Pelosi say they will work out a deal, but bipartisan negotiations on the particulars have not begun.The deadline is tight—the House is scheduled to break for its August recess at the end of the month, and the Senate will break a week later. Meanwhile, the White House was still working out its own priorities with Republicans.  It's not going to be a White House plan, it’s going to be us working with the Senate,  says Treasury chief Steven Mnuchin. (The White House reportedly doesn't want to include money for testing or contact tracing.)",

Daryll Rowe, 27, was sentenced Wednesday to life behind bars with a minimum term of 12 years for infecting five men via unprotected sex and trying to infect five others by damaging condoms, the BBC reports. Rowe was diagnosed with the virus in April 2015, and then embarked upon what the judge called a  determined hateful campaign of sly violence,  meeting men on gay dating app Grindr for sex. After they slept together, he would send them messages like  I have HIV LOL. Oops.  After having sex with eight men between October 2015 and February 2016, Rowe went on the run from police and had sex with two more men. He lied, telling the men he did not have the virus, but pressured them for unprotected sex or tampered with condoms if they refused, the Guardian reports.  Many of those men were young men in their 20s at the time they had the misfortune to meet you,  the judge said.  They describe living with a life sentence as a result of your cruel and senseless acts. ... I cannot see how and when you will no longer be a danger to gay men.  Some of Rowe's victims testified to having considered suicide after finding out they had been infected; one said he would have rather Rowe  murdered  him.",

Some 400 miles away, the news is bringing relief to one family, reports the Washington Post. The Portland Press Herald has the  ironic  story of Douglas Parkhurst, who was at the Babe Ruth baseball game his grandson was participating in and was killed by the car driven by Carol Sharrow, 51. Parkhurst himself confessed to a deadly hit-and-run in 2013, bringing some answers but little solace to the family of Carolee Ashby, a 4-year-old killed on Oct. 31, 1968, as she walked to a store in Fulton, New York, with her then 15-year-old sister to buy birthday candles for the teenager's cake. Though police initially eyed Parkhurst as a suspect, a 2012 tip to police was what ended up spurring Parkhurst's confession. That confession reportedly came only after Parkhurst received assurances from prosecutors that the statute of limitations had passed and he would not be prosecuted. Darlene Ashby McCann, the sister who was with Carolee when she was killed, says her family never received an apology from Parkhurst. Still,  now I am relieved,  she says.  I truly am. The same thing that happened to my sister happened to him. It made a complete circle.  The Bangor Daily News reports that while police did not state whether they believe alcohol was a factor, Sharrow does have at least one drunken driving conviction and a second previous drunken driving charge. Police have uncovered no connection between Sharrow and Parkhurst, who was reportedly trying to close a gate on the field to prevent Sharrow from fleeing the scene when he was hit. He died en route to the hospital.",

The Verge reports there was one especially notable achievement for SpaceX during this test flight: The unmanned Crew Dragon managed to dock itself to an exterior ISS port, a move the company had never done before, and one that's needed if SpaceX eventually ferries people to the space station. There was one  witness  on board the capsule: a  smart  test dummy named Ripley, which was built to measure how the human body would be affected. This was the first test flight for the Crew Dragon, which will be retrieved from the ocean by a SpaceX recovery vessel.

Equifax ... had a responsibility to secure and protect Americans' data. Instead, it breached public trust,  reads a statement from California Attorney General Xavier Becerra in announcing the deal, reports the San Francisco Chronicle. Per the settlement terms, Equifax doesn't have to admit to any wrongdoing for  one of the most devastating data breaches to face our nation,  he adds. Equifax will also offer at least 10 years of free credit-monitoring services to consumers who've been affected by the leak of such critical personal data as names, Social Security numbers, addresses, birthdates, driver's license numbers, and passport and credit card information. The AP notes consumers will also be able to take advantage of free identity-restoration services and, starting Dec. 31, six free copies of their credit report in a 12-month span, for at least the next seven years.

But the two later became friends, with Fauci crediting Kramer, who died Wednesday morning, with playing a key role in the development of drug treatments that could help people with HIV live longer lives. Kramer's husband, David Webster, says the 84-year-old died from pneumonia, the New York Times reports. Kramer was an outspoken advocate for AIDS research starting in the early '80s, when the disease was being called the  gay plague,  reports the Washington Post. He founded the Gay Men’s Health Crisis group in New York in 1982, followed by the more radical ACT UP in 1987. ACT UP fought to raise awareness with stunts like shutting down the New York Stock Exchange and covering the house of conservative Sen. Jesse Helms in a giant condom. Susan Sontag once called Kramer  one of America's most valuable troublemakers,  and Kramer, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1988, acknowledged that  we’re not here to make friends, we’re here to raise the issues.  His largely autobiographical play The Normal Heart, which looked at the early days of the AIDS crisis in New York, won awards on Broadway and became an Emmy-winning TV drama. In March he started work on a play about gay men living through the  three plagues  of AIDS, aging, and COVID-19.  The government has been awful in both cases,  he told the Times.

The safety of the American people, of all people, is our paramount concern.  That means no nations are left flying the planes, USA Today reports. Earlier Wednesday, Canada's transport minister announced the country was closing its airspace to the aircraft, which has been involved in two major fatal crashes in less than five months: Indonesia's Lion Air crash in October and Sunday's Ethiopian Airlines crash. Both the US and Canadian bans also extend to the larger Max 9, CNN reports; Trump said, per CNN, that any Max 8 or 9 planes currently in the air would be ordered to land. The two crashes have not been officially linked, but when announcing Canada's ban Marc Garneau referenced newly available satellite data of the planes' vertical paths that suggests similarities between the two, the New York Times reports. Though he cautioned that the  new information is not conclusive,  Garneau said officials and experts had looked at the data from both flights and found similarities that  exceed a certain threshold in our minds with respect to the possible cause of what happened in Ethiopia. This is not conclusive, but it is something that points possibly in that direction, and at this point we feel that threshold has been crossed.

Just a week or so later, more than 107,000 people had signed up. That's a number USA Today says will  go a long way  toward getting at least 30,000 volunteers for each of four companies set to start the third phase of clinical trials in the early fall. Those four companies: Moderna, AstraZeneca, Inovio, and Pfizer/BioNTech. Dr. Anthony Fauci says this volunteer surge has made him  optimistic  about conducting the trials sooner rather than later.  This is what we call medical heroes,  Sarah Hasan, a recruiter for a Houston clinic, tells KHOU.  The interest we're seeing right now is on a whole different level.  Volunteers go through a rigorous application procedure, including signing a consent form that can be up to 100 pages long. Half of the participants will receive the potential vaccine, while the other half will get a placebo—another reason plenty of volunteers are needed.  A lot of people drop out right there,  UC San Francisco epidemiology professor Robert Hiatt tells USA Today.  They say, 'No, I don't want it if I don't get the vaccine.  For those who fear a vaccine may be rushed, a Harvard public health professor tries to ease those concerns.  The guidelines for these trials are really clear,  says immunologist Barry Bloom.  They will be scientifically rigorous and there are no shortcuts.  For example, one of the requirements before a clinical trial can move on to phase 3 is that the testing has to go well in animal trials. While finding volunteers for such a large clinical trial is typically a monthslong endeavor, Hiatt sees a difference this time:  The altruistic aspect of this is appealing. People want to be part of the cure.  (Oxford reported promising early results Monday.)",

I prefer younger women’s bodies, that’s all. End of,  he concluded.  The body of a 25-year-old woman is extraordinary. The body of a woman of 50 is not extraordinary at all.  Moix, who is also the host of a popular TV talk show, has won several literary prizes and directed three films, the Guardian reports. His comments, not surprisingly, sparked quite an uproar, with many calling him out on social media for both ageism and sexism.  Hey # YannMoix can women under 50 également be invisible to you as well please. Signed all women of all ages everywhere,  reads one sample tweet. Others pointed out his apparent hypocrisy:  Yann Moix, does it happen to you that a 50 year old woman might prefer a younger man's body too? As a 50 year old man, is your body 'extraordinary?' l doubt it,  pondered one. Moix was also drawing backlash for his comments during the interview that he prefers dating  Koreans, Chinese, and Japanese,  the BBC reports. He seemed to be taking the controversy in stride, telling RTL radio in response,  I like who I like and I don't have to answer to the court of taste  and joking,  50-year-old women do not see me either! They have something else to do than to get around a neurotic who writes and reads all day long. It's not easy to be with me.

But that was before satellites combed the region. Archaeologists at the University of Exeter who surveyed satellite images in areas of deforestation have uncovered 81 previously unknown Amazon settlements—some covering hectares, others as small as 100 feet wide—marked by fortification ditches, sunken roads, ceramic fragments, and earth platforms on which wooden houses would've stood between 1250 and 1500, reports the Guardian.  We filled the last piece of a puzzle in Amazonian archaeology,  study author Jonas Gregorio de Souza tells Live Science, describing a network of settlements believed to have covered 154,000 square miles of the Amazon's southern rim, perhaps supporting a population in the millions in the pre-Columbian era. Archaeologists couldn't get access to all 81 sites in the upper Tapajós Basin, but examined 24 in person and believe hundreds more exist. In addition to upending the idea that the Amazon was mostly untouched, their study in Nature Communications  definitively discredits early low estimates of 1.5-2 million inhabitants for the whole basin,  they say, per USA Today, and shows settlements next to small streams and springs may have hosted large populations. Though linked to other settlements, the sites each have  a different local expression of … architectural traditions,  says de Souza.  There are different kinds of site layouts and artifacts that are found in each of the regions.  De Souza adds many questions remain, but  the big debate is how populations were distributed.  Scientists expect to learn more as additional sites are discovered and examined. (Stonehenge-like structures were also found in the Amazon.)",

Longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone admits he met a man with a thick Russian accent in Florida in 2016, and the man—who went by the name Henry Greenberg—wanted $2 million for political dirt on Hillary Clinton. Stone says he refused and texted Trump communications official Michael Caputo that the meeting was a  waste of time.  Now, talking to the Washington Post, Stone and Caputo have produced records showing that Greenberg is a Russian national who claims to have worked for the FBI.  I didn't realize it was an FBI sting operation at the time, but it sure looks like one now,  says Stone. Greenberg denies Stone's account, saying he brought a Ukrainian friend to the meeting who did the talking. Greenberg has a colorful history, having lived in Moscow with Hollywood film producer John Daly, frequented the city's club scene, and battled charges that he had defrauded a firm out of $2.7 million.  He is strikingly good-looking—tall with graying dark hair—and oozes self-confidence,  the Moscow Times wrote in 2002. Greenberg also claimed in a US court filing to have worked as an FBI informant for years, but says he stopped after 2013. For their part, Caputo and Stone failed to reveal the Greenberg meeting to Congressional investigators but say their memories were recently jogged by text messages.  How crazy is the Russian?  texted Caputo after the meeting. Stone replied,  Wants big &$ for the info- waste of time.  Caputo:  The Russian way. Anything at all interesting?

A statement from pipeline owner TC Energy says that about 383,000 gallons of crude oil—the equivalent of half an Olympic-size swimming pool, notes the Washington Post—have saturated half an acre near the Canadian border, a few miles from the town of Edinburg. The somewhat good news: No people or wildlife have been reported injured, per a TC Energy statement, and because no one lives right near this section of wetland, which isn't a source of drinking water, a risk to public health isn't a concern at the moment, says a rep from the state's Department of Environmental Quality. The company says the oil has been contained and an investigation and cleanup is underway. In November 2017, a spill near Amherst, SD, leaked out 407,000 gallons of oil; the National Transportation Safety Board says that spill was likely from a growing crack caused by a construction vehicle. There've been multiple smaller spills along the pipeline over the past decade as well. The AP reports the spill coincided Tuesday with a public meeting held on the pipeline, in Billings, Mont., part of the environmental review mandated by a federal judge who blocked the pipeline's extension last year.

A Los Angeles federal judge decided he should be let out of prison ASAP. US District Court Judge Stephen V. Wilson ruled Thursday that 73-year-old Juan Carlos Seresi, whose projected  release  date had been set for June 2419, should be freed  without delay  after cutting Seresi's sentence to time served. Seresi's reaction?  It's a miracle,  his daughter Patti Mawer says he exclaimed upon hearing the news. In 1991, Seresi and three other men were sentenced to 505 years in prison for laundering drug money for a cartel. A previous CNN article noted that prosecutors came to Wilson in August to have the convictions overturned, citing special treatment given to a government witness that hadn't been disclosed to the defense. Wilson denied that request, but Seresi's legal team filed a motion asking for his release based on compassionate grounds, noting his age and health issues could make him vulnerable to COVID-19. Wilson found those factors, taken together with others—including that Seresi's offense had been a nonviolent one and that he'd earned three associate degrees and stayed out of trouble during his 30 years in prison—amounted to  extraordinary and compelling reasons  why he should be released. It's not yet clear when that will happen. Meanwhile, Seresi and his three co-defendants, who are still serving out their centuries-long sentences, are appealing their case.

Now, the  crown jewel of Beverly Hills  as it is dubbed by the listing agent is on the market again. And the $1 billion asking price makes it the most expensive listing in LA history  by a mile,  the LA Times reports. Dubbed  The Mountain,  the property is divided into 17 parcels, each between 2.7 and 12.2 acres each, according to Forbes. It's zoned for buildings of up to 48 feet tall. And while previous owners' visions of vast compounds and palaces were never realized, The Mountain is landscaped, giving it, per the New York Times,  the surreal feel of an empty, mountaintop golf course.  Even with its sweeping views of all of Los Angeles, the Pacific Ocean, and Catalina Island (smog allowing), The Mountain is  wildly overpriced,  real estate executive Stephen Shaprio tells the NYT.  For a billion dollars, you could buy it multiple times,  he says, adding that $200 million may be more realistic.

The latest to enter the revolving door is Scott Morrison, who emerged triumphant Friday after Malcolm Turnbull was forced out by his own party, the BBC reports. Members of the ruling Liberal Party—the more conservative of Australia's two main parties—forced a leadership contest in which Turnbull declined to stand. Morrison, a hardline conservative who served as treasurer under Turnbull, beat former Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton 45-40 in an internal ballot.  It has been such a privilege to be the leader of this great nation,  Turnbull said.  I love Australia. I love Australians.  Turnbull is the fourth prime minister to have been forced out by colleagues over the last decade, and his exit may lead to a new election, the Guardian reports. He says he won't stay in government, which will erase the Liberal-led coalition's single-seat majority. Turnbull was forced out by a right-wing rebellion in his party that Peter Hartcher, writing in the Sydney Morning Herald, calls  pointless.   It brought down a prime minister, destabilized the government, damaged the standing of the ruling party, unsettled the country, and made Australian democracy an even bigger laughing stock,  he writes.  Without satisfying the disgruntled faction that started it all.  (In 2015, Turnbull's predecessor denounced  treachery  after he was ousted by his own party.)",

Turns out it wasn't, the ex-manager of a Mavis Discount Tire now claims, adding a new twist to the story, USA Today and the Times Union report. In a letter filed in court this week by Schoharie County DA Susan Mallery, Virgil Park—who used to run the shop where the 2001 stretch Ford Excursion owned by Prestige Limousine was taken for service—told the DA's office last month a worker at his shop later told him the brake part was never installed; Park adds the part was returned to the vendor 8 days later. An investigator-hired expert has already reported the crash was caused by  catastrophic brake failure,  though the state's Department of Transportation hasn't yet officially weighed in. Park claims it was apparently regular practice to falsify invoices in order to try to meet sales quotas from corporate and that a June 2018 invoice related to the limo and brake work was also falsified. Meanwhile, a trial for Nauman Hussain, who ran Prestige Limo and has been charged with criminally negligent homicide and manslaughter, will be held in March. Hussain allegedly kept the limo in rotation despite it failing two inspections and being ordered off the road by the NY DOT. In their own filing, Hussain's lawyers note,  Mavis's fraudulent conduct ... was the true legal cause of the accident.

AL.com reports that how he paid for all of this is now being called into question due to some ethics disclosure paperwork he recently filed with the state, in which he noted he has received more than $750,000 in  compensation  over the past three years from a  Food Provisions  account—namely, funds offered by federal, state, and municipal governments to feed prisoners in the Etowah County Jail. And Entrekin says it's completely legal, based on an antiquated state law passed before World War II that apparently allows sheriffs to keep  excess  funds meant to feed prisoners. AL.com says the state law is  likely  being exploited by other Alabama sheriffs as well. However, other counties that end up with a surplus give the money to the county government so it can be put to use elsewhere instead of lining the sheriffs' pockets.  I believe the funds belong to the taxpayers and any excess funds should go toward things that benefit the taxpayer,  the police chief of Rainbow City, who used to work under the former Etowah County sheriff, says.  There's been a tremendous amount of money left over that shouldn't be used as a bonus check.

The Transportation Security Administration is offering to eliminate screenings entirely at small and medium-sized airports in a new cost-saving effort, CNN reports.

But the removal of screenings at more than 150 airports with flights carrying 60 passengers or less—with savings of $115 million—is getting the most attention. As CNN reported earlier, the proposal would have luggage and passengers on those flights screened after they land at larger airports for connecting flights.

A New Zealand researcher says it's actually an important clue into the ruler's demise. Dr. Katherine Hall explains that upon Alexander's death in 323BC, it was recorded that his body went six days without exhibiting signs of decomposition. The leading theories as to what killed him—infection, alcoholism or murder—don't explain that. And Hall, of the University of Otago's Dunedin School of Medicine, thinks she knows what does. The twist? She thinks Alexander wasn't decomposing because he was still alive. Here's her theory: that he contracted the neurological disorder Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) from a common infection of the time. GBS would have cause the  progressive, symmetrical, ascending paralysis  he was noted as experiencing prior to death. And that death really came six days later than thought, theorizes Hall in an article published in the Ancient History Bulletin.

Believed to have been descending into the gold mine shaft near Aguila, 90 miles northwest of Phoenix, when he fell Monday, 62-year-old John Waddell suffered two broken legs, per FOX 10. But his hardships didn't end there. The father also battled three rattlesnakes (now dead) and severe dehydration over 48 hours without food or water before a neighbor discovered him Wednesday. Terry Schrader had agreed to check on Waddell at the shaft if he didn't return by Tuesday, though it was Wednesday before he actually went searching.  I was afraid of what I was going to find,  Schrader says.  As I pulled up my truck, I could hear him hollering, 'Help, help.'  Schrader adds, per ABC15, that  the carabiner broke, I guess, and he supposedly fell 40 to 50 feet.  Though Waddell had a phone, there was no cell service; Schrader had to drive out of the desert to call authorities. The Maricopa County Sheriff's Office organized the rescue beginning around 2pm, reports the Arizona Republic. It took more than six hours and a team of more than a dozen before Waddell could be airlifted to a hospital.  We are looking forward to his recovery,  an MCSO rep says. Regardless of his screams as he was removed from the shaft,  he's a tough guy,  Schrader says. (Rescuers decided to abandon efforts to pull a man out of a Nevada mine shaft.)",

The way his 13 keys work is that each one is answered true or false.  True  indicates the White House party will retain power. Six or more false answers equal a political earthquake. Some of the keys are pretty basic political factors: Key No. 2, for instance:  There is no primary contest for the White House party.  True. Others are economic, like Key No. 6:  Long-term economic growth during this presidential term has been as good as the past two terms.  False.

The case brought against the Justice Department by five plaintiffs—including Alexis Bortell, who uses medical marijuana to treat her epilepsy, and former NFL player Marvin Washington, who sells marijuana-based pain relievers—heads to a New York court on Wednesday, reports the New York Times. The case before Judge Alvin K.

Filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan in July, the suit gained increased attention after Jeff Sessions last month opened up the option for prosecutors to enforce federal law in states where marijuana has been decriminalized. The lawsuit claims the Schedule 1 drug has been used by everyone from Thomas Jefferson, who apparently found it eased his migraines, to ancient Egyptians, who used it to treat eye sores and hemorrhoids, and is only banned based on efforts to target hippies and black Americans after the 1960s. The Cannabis Cultural Association, another plaintiff in the suit, argues  the Controlled Substances Act has been enforced against people of color exponentially more than Caucasians,  a lawyer tells the Cannabis Business Times.

And scientists said they see no end to the way man-made climate change keeps shattering records, the AP reports. The 2010s averaged 58.4 degrees Fahrenheit worldwide, or 1.4 degrees higher than the 20th century average and more than one-third of a degree warmer than the previous decade, which had been the hottest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The decade had eight of the 10 hottest years on record. The only other years in the top 10 were 2005 and 1998. NASA and NOAA also calculated that 2019 was the second-hottest year in the 140 years of record-keeping. Five other global teams of monitoring scientists agreed, based on temperature readings taken on Earth's surface, while various satellite-based measurements said it was anywhere from the hottest year on record to the third-hottest. Several scientists said the coming years will be even hotter, knocking these years out of the record books.  If you think you've heard this story before, you haven't seen anything yet,  Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies, said at the close of a decade plagued by raging wildfires, melting ice and extreme weather that researchers have repeatedly tied to human activity. Schmidt said Earth as a whole is probably the hottest it has been during the Holocene—the past 11,500 years or so—meaning this could be the warmest period since the dawn of civilization. But scientists' estimates of ancient global temperatures, based on tree rings, ice cores and other telltale signs, are not precise enough to say that with certainty.

The center in southwestern Dhamar province had around 170 detainees. The Red Cross said 40 wounded were being treated for injuries while the rest were presumed dead, the AP reports. Franz Rauchenstein, the head of the Red Cross delegation in Yemen, suggested that the death toll could be higher. He visited the site of Sunday's attack, saying relatively few detainees survived. The Saudi-led coalition, which has waged war on the Iran-backed Houthis since 2015, has faced international criticism for airstrikes that have hit schools, hospitals, and wedding parties, killing thousands of civilians.",

And still, his ex-wife kept plotting his death, according to prosecutors in King County, Wash., who've charged her and two teenagers with premeditated attempted first-degree murder.  It wasn't a surprise. I knew I was in her way,  Li, 48, tells the Seattle Times, noting the pair have been engaged in a custody battle over their disabled 6-year-old son, who has a trust fund containing  quite a bit of money.  He tells KIRO 7 that a  crazy  Shaerin Kelley had twice tried to run him over. Prosecutors say Kelley, 30, plotted the July shooting with Joseph Good and Quincy Mendez, both 17. Good allegedly shot Li with the expectation of receiving $13,000. Mendez is accused of driving his friend for $5,000. Detectives learned Good had access to a GPS device belonging to Kelley, which was found on Li's car, per charging documents. Good was also found in possession of two guns, prosecutors say. Weeks after the shooting, Good texted Kelley asking for payment, not realizing Li had survived, the documents add, per the Washington Post.  Job unfinished, will need to complete unless it resolves on its own in the next month,  Kelley allegedly responded. Prosecutors note Kelley  would stand to obtain significant funds  with sole custody of the couple's son. She lost primary custody in 2017, when the boy was put in foster care, per the Times; Li won primary custody in May 2019. Kelley was granted overnight weekend visits, but those were reduced to supervised visits in March. Kelley is now held without bail. Charged as adults, Good and Mendez remain in custody, with bail set at $2 million each.",

Relatives of the Rev. Joseph E. Lowery say the 98-year-old died at home in Atlanta of natural causes not related to the coronavirus, with family by his side, the AP reports. Said to be the  dean  of the civil rights movement, Lowery began his fight for racial equality in the late 1950s, when, as an Alabama pastor, he co-founded the SCLC with King. He was elected president of the organization in 1977, but much of his work escaped media attention in the '80s and '90s, which bothered him, per the Washington Post, which notes Lowery  often said the media thought 'the movement died with Martin.'  Lowery retired from the SCLC in 1997, and 10 years later became a big supporter of Barack Obama as he ran for president.  We ask you to help us work for that day when black will not be asked to get in back; when brown can stick around; when yellow will be mellow; when the red man can get ahead, man; and when white will embrace what is right,  Lowery, who was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2009, prayed at Obama's benediction. Even after he retired, Lowery continued to fight against poverty, racism, capital punishment, and war, per CNN. In addition to his civil rights work, Lowery was a pastor at Methodist churches for 50 years.  Tonight, the great Reverend Joseph E.

In a Des Moines Register column, the former governor of Maryland says he hopes the former Democratic congressman who staged a  courageous run for US Senate in Texas  last year, ultimately losing to incumbent Ted Cruz, runs for the White House. Back in 2016,  America wasn’t in the mood for new leadership. We were in a mood of anger, rage and retribution. And in this mood, Donald Trump’s candidacy rose,  O'Malley writes. But now, things have changed:  People are looking for a new leader who can bring us together.  He recounts the two years he spent campaigning with more than 120 Democratic candidates in more than 30 states at every level of government and his finding that  voters were clearly longing for new leadership.  It's impressive that O'Rourke came so close to beating Cruz in Texas, and O'Malley believes the country would embrace O'Rourke if he were to run for president.  Because he is of a new generation, O’Rourke understands that a new way of governing—with openness, transparency, and performance—is called for to tackle our problems in the Information Age,  O'Malley writes. As Politico explains, there had been rumors O'Malley himself would run again in 2020, but he makes it clear in his column (read it in full here) he will not.

Researchers at the State University of New York tested 259 bottles of water bought in nine countries, including the US, and found that 93% of them were contaminated with tiny plastic particles, the Guardian reports. The team says they found an average 10.4 pieces of plastic at least the size of a hair per liter. An average of 314 smaller particles per liter were also believed to be plastic. Some bottles had thousands of particles. The researchers say that despite some bottled water brands being marketed as purer, contamination was around double that found in an earlier study on microplastic contamination of tap water. Researchers, who used dye to detect the particles, say there are many ways the microplastics could have entered the water, including from the plastic bottle tops. The health implications of consuming microplastics are still unclear, though researchers warn that they can absorb harmful chemicals.

In a jargony four-page letter sent to Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, some 19 ICE investigators propose that ICE be done away with, and that two distinct entities emerge. The letter explains ICE is made up of two distinct components: Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI); those signing the letter work in the latter section. The letter outlines  numerous reasons  why turning those into two standalone agencies would make sense, among them the low approval ratings that have surfaced in employee surveys. But their larger point is that their work is polluted by that of ERO, which detains and deports undocumented immigrants, while HSI has an  extraordinary global reach  and focuses on  transnational criminal organizations that facilitate cross border crimes  like drug smuggling and human trafficking. They say there is misunderstanding about what HSI does, and that the  political nature  of what ERO does has led local law enforcement in some cases to refuse to work with HSI under the misguided idea that it is involved in the  politics of civil immigration ; others partner so long as  ICE  isn't referenced in any public-facing materials.

On Monday, the state medical examiner exhumed the bodies of the women, both of whom died in an infamous 1944 circus fire in Hartford, reports the AP. The blaze took 168 lives, including five people whose badly burned remains have never been identified. Authorities hope to extract DNA from the bodies in Windsor's Northwood Cemetery to see if they match up with a granddaughter of Fifield's. The latter was a Vermont woman who attended the fateful performance of the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus on July 6, 1944, and was never seen again.  The next steps include dental and anthropological evaluation of the remains followed by DNA testing,  says Chief State Medical Examiner James Gill, per the Hartford Courant. The process could take months. Authorities caught a break when they determined that the unidentified victims were buried in cement vaults, which would have helped preserve their remains. In addition to the 168 fatalities, nearly 700 others were injured in the fire, whose cause was never determined. Not helping: The tent had been waterproofed with a mixture of gasoline and paraffin wax, notes the Courant, which collects memories of the day from survivors here.

But it got some relief this week when a couple paid $40,000 for a single bottle of bourbon, per WFLA. The owners, Suzanne Perry and husband Roger, had opted to sell off pricey liquor to avoid going under. The most valuable was a bottle of 25-year-aged Pappy Van Winkle Kentucky bourbon, one of just 710 produced, which Perry listed at the discounted price of $17,000. A couple eventually agreed to buy the bottle over the phone, while asking probing questions about the state of affairs at Datz. And when they showed up, they handed over a check for more than twice the asking price. Perry's husband thought the check was a mistake and tried to return it. But the anonymous buyer, a local philanthropist and veteran,  said, 'No, I want you to have it, and I want you to use it for your staff,'  Perry tells the Tampa Bay Times.  I was so moved by that incredible generosity that I literally had to leave,  she tells WFTS. The check meant Datz could bring back several staffers, who will now be put to work making meals for people on the front lines of the outbreak.  You've inspired many many others to give and be generous,  Perry tells the buyer, per WFTS.

The company has lacked regulator approval to fly the plane since March, after two of the jets crashed and killed a total of 346 people. Layoffs aren't planned at the Washington assembly plant that has 12,000 workers, the Wall Street Journal reports, but the effects are likely to be widespread.  It would be hard to have any other single company stop the production of a single product and have it hit the economy as hard as this would,  an analyst said, predicting that domestic GDP growth in the first quarter could lose 0.3 of a percentage point. GE, which makes engines for the 737 MAX, had already said the grounding could exact as much as a $1.4 billion hit on its cash flow this year. Boeing had hoped regulators would allow the plane's return by the end of the year, but was told last week that won't happen before February. Airlines have had to cancel thousands of flights and have lost hundreds of millions of dollars, per CNBC. Southwest has reached a settlement with Boeing and plans to pass $125 million along to its employees. But the airline's pilots say that's not enough to make up for their lost wages and plan to recover more through a lawsuit, a step that flight attendants unions also are considering. Boeing did not say how long the production freeze would last; the plant has been turning out about 40 737 MAX planes per month even during the grounding.

As the Des Moines Register reports, new rules this year make it possible that three different candidates could emerge from the Feb. 3 caucuses claiming to be the winner. The short version of the explanation: The state Democratic Party will for the first time be disclosing raw vote totals from the caucuses. The longer explanation involves an understanding of the arcane way the state caucuses work. As reporter Brianne Pfannenstiel writes, the traditional  winner  in Iowa has long been decided  by a complicated system of state delegate equivalents, which operates kind of like the Electoral College.  That won't change—one candidate will still be the winner in terms of delegates. But the state party will for the first time disclose raw totals from the first count of votes at gatherings (the  first alignment ), as well as from the second and final one. Of course, one candidate could sweep them all,  but it's also fully possible that a different candidate could 'win' each of the three metrics,  writes Pfannenstiel. Each would come with its own bragging points. Meanwhile, an analysis at Fortune makes the case that while Iowa typically doesn't decide who will be president, it plays a strong role in deciding who won't be president.

Make those payment for 20 years (25 if it's graduate school debt, notes Forbes). Hit that date and see whatever is left wiped away—and there might be a ton left, as the payments are often smaller than the interest that's being accrued. The Wall Street Journal reports these  income-driven repayment plans  have been available through the Education Department since 2007, meaning balances won't start going to zero until 2027. And when they do, expect a  bomb.  That's because the balance that's forgiven is considered income for that year, meaning the borrower has to pay tax on it. The Journal does the math: One estimate expects such borrowers to have $41,000 forgiven on average. At a 25% income tax rate, that would mean a $10,250 tax bill. On the more eye-popping end of the spectrum, it references an orthodontist it interviewed who had student-loan debt in excess of $1 million; that associated tax bill could be $700,000. (Forbes notes the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program doesn't levy taxes on the forgiven amount).  I'm very doubtful that everybody is going to be able to make these tax payments,  said Constantine Yannelis, who worked in the Treasury Department under Obama.

Per the Willamette Week, a 45-foot, 8-ton sperm whale washed up on the shores of Florence in late 1970, and on Nov. 12, the state's highway division decided to dispose of the rotting, stinky carcass in what it believed would be the most efficient way: by detonating 20 cases (a half-ton) of dynamite around it. KATU-TV sent reporter Paul Linnman and cameraman Doug Brazil to the bizarre scene; they camped out about a quarter of a mile away to document the detonation, per the Oregon Historical Society. The KATU video of the explosion went viral decades later after it was unearthed and posted to YouTube.  For the blast blasted blubber beyond all believable bounds,  Linnman says in the segment, which then shows the blast. It's followed by this from Linnman:  The humor of the entire situation suddenly gave way to a run for survival.  That's because huge chunks of whale blubber rained down on spectators instead of being thrown closer to the ocean.  A piece of blubber the size of a coffee table hit the top of an Oldsmobile and completely flattened the roof,  Linnman told the Oregonian in 2004. The reason the video is suddenly making the rounds again is because the OHS has released a newly restored version of the 16mm footage in honor of the explosion's 50th anniversary (you can watch the longer restored version of the video here).

Fox says that according to its poll, a record 51% of voters want Trump to be impeached and removed from office. Another 4% want him to be impeached but not removed from office, and 40% oppose impeachment. Fox says support for impeachment has gone up among all groups since July, including Republicans. According to the poll, 39% of voters think doing what is best for the country is most important to Trump—and 55% think it is doing what is best for himself. On the issue behind the impeachment inquiry, 66% said it was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate a political rival. The Fox poll, conducted Sunday through Tuesday, found that just 43% of voters have a favorable opinion of Trump—though that still puts him a point ahead of Nancy Pelosi, and 16 points ahead of Rep. Adam Schiff. Only 26% had a favorable opinion of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Other polls have delivered similar results, the AP reports. A Quinnipiac University poll in early October found 45% in favor of removing Trump from office, and a Washington Post poll the same week had 49% in favor.

How did the South Carolina 20-year-old go from straight-A student and National Honor Society member to that point? She explains in a first-person piece in Cosmopolitan, charting her path from drinking alcohol and smoking pot at 18 to taking Xanax and then, finally, taking meth and ecstasy. Along the way she struggled with her mental health—she had a mental breakdown at one point and ultimately found out she has bipolar disorder—as well as other things, having left high school in eleventh grade after missing a lot of school due to work and a heart arrhythmia and, at 17, moving out of her mom's house. Ultimately she left her job, too, and lost her boyfriend and a number of close friends as she continued to struggle with drug abuse. After initially avoiding harder drugs, she was smoking pot with an acquaintance at 19 when she felt a strange, euphoric high. She determined the pot had likely been laced with cocaine or meth, and at a particularly low point, she later decided to try meth and ecstasy. Her addiction progressed to the point that she was shooting meth  as often as I could,  though she tried to stop multiple times. As her mom tried to get a court order to commit her so she could get treatment, Muthart took the largest dose of meth she ever had. She ended up feeling everyone in the world would die if she didn't make a sacrifice, thinking she was having  a personal religious calling.  She gouged out her own eyes and fought the passers-by who held her down to keep her from doing more damage. Now, she'll never see again, but she's off illegal drugs, on medication, and in treatment.

Archaeologists found the prints on an island in British Columbia, Canada, while seeking evidence of the Coastal Migration Theory, which posits that humans traveled down the coast after crossing over from Eurasia—versus the long-running notion that they followed game herds into North America's interior as glaciers melted.  The footprints ... add to the growing body of evidence that humans inhabited the Pacific coast of Canada  in an era that ended about 11,700 years ago, per the study published this week. Makes sense, Gizmodo points out, since the ocean is great for finding food and much of North America was still plagued by glaciers at that time. Yet the huge block of ice that barred passage from Eurasia to North America—the Cordilleran Ice Sheet—melted about 15,000 to 16,000 years ago, and archaeologists radiocarbon dated the footprints to about 13,000 years ago, so they may just show inhabitants rather than pioneers moving down the coast. The find  would push evidence of Northwest Coast human occupation back about 400 years, but it still postdates the widespread occurrence of ... populations throughout North America,  says an archaeologist not involved in the study.

The New York Times reports at least 126 children adopted there between 1946 and 1969 were told their adoptive parents were their birth parents, complete with altered birth certificates—and some speculate that number is just the start. In fact, hundreds or even thousands more may have been illegally adopted out, per the CEO of an Irish children's charity, all part of the nation's longtime stigma against unwed mothers.  This was a crime against these people and their mothers—mothers who were told that their babies had died,  Barnardo's head Fergus Finlay tells RTE, via IrishCentral.com, adding:  Some women have gone through years and years of trauma.  The St. Patrick's Guild adoption agency was the one identified as having falsified the 126 adoptions out of 13,500 it arranged over that period. Many of those kids, now mostly senior citizens, still don't know they're adopted; Varadkar says the government is trying to contact them all.  What was done robbed children ... of their identity,  he said.  It was [a] historic wrong.  The 126 confirmed false adoptions were unearthed by the government's Tusla child protection agency. St. Patrick's Guild was just one of seven large adoption agencies in Ireland during that time, with many smaller ones as well, and some (if not all) of them may have practiced similar deception; Finlay believes another 150,000 adoptions should be reviewed.  I suspect every single adoption agency in the country is involved,  Finlay says.",

Nguyen Van Nhat was taken to a hospital in Vietnam's Quang Tri province Dec. 25 after falling unconscious with over 1,000 times the safe limit of methanol—a hazardous kind of alcohol—in his system. Doctors transfused roughly a can of beer an hour into his system to limit the methanol processed by his liver, which helped save his life. To understand all this requires some knowledge of ethanol and methanol. Most commercially available alcoholic drinks contain ethanol but not methanol, which can still be found in bootleg booze, cleaning products, paints, thinners, antifreeze, and so on. This dangerous substance gets metabolized by an enzyme in the body and converted into formaldehyde, a toxic compound that gets turned into formic acid; together, these substances cause methanol poisoning, which can blind or even kill you. But the beer's ethanol can stop the formaldehyde from being turned into formic acid. That's what gave Nguyen Van Nhat's doctors extra time to perform dialysis, cleanse his body of alcohol, and discharge him about three weeks later, per the Daily Mail.

Granted, Ellingwood opened the door by beginning a bankruptcy filing in 2012. But even though he never finished it, a lien was placed on the property, allowing a company called Strategic Acquisitions to buy his home. Turns out there are dozens of similar companies that bought foreclosed properties around America after the 2007 housing crisis, turning them into profit-makers now worth $60 billion. In fact, Wall Street investors bought 95% of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac's distressed properties without any real conditions, creating a single-family rental market that they funded with new kinds of bonds and shares—which the companies can only afford to reimburse by charging tenants stiff fees and higher rents. A top company says it fixes up homes and has a 96% occupancy rate, but there's a Facebook group of irate tenants struggling to fight back. Meanwhile the Wall Street Journal reported last year that Blackstone, a major firm that invested in all this, walked away with $7 billion. Which leaves Ellingwood where?

So reports evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar this month in the journal Royal Society Open Science, after analyzing research conducted in April and May of 2015 involving 3,375 people ages 18 to 65. While women typically have larger social circles than men, the average number of Facebook friends among this sample was 150, reports CNET. But the average number of friends one can truly count on in a crisis is just four—which reflects one's offline numbers, and is remarkably consistent across backgrounds, gender, and age. Dunbar defines several friendship levels, each panning out from the four or five closest friends the average person maintains, reports the Washington Post. From there, most of us widen the circle of  sympathy  friends we feel we can confide in to 15, and widen it again to 50 friends who are  close.  Most of us can't seem to maintain much more than 150  casual  friends, though, and the typical realm of total acquaintances tops out at 500. Even those with thousands of Facebook friends aren't necessarily more social, Dunbar concludes:  Respondents who had unusually large networks did not increase the numbers of close friendships they had, but rather added more loosely defined acquaintances into their friendship circle.  And while social media can help slow the natural rate of  decay  that occurs over time,  that alone may not be sufficient to prevent friendships eventually dying naturally if they are not occasionally reinforced by face-to-face interaction,  he adds.

He was playing with his 9-year-old sister on their property in remote Wallowa County when he realized he had lost his bearings. He didn't do what lost kids are taught to do—stay put—or what they often do instead—walk in circles. He spotted a road, thought it might lead him to somewhere, and luckily picked the proper direction to travel: out, not deeper into the mountains. By the time a search and rescue team was assembled, he was already miles away, and well beyond their perimeter. After walking as many as 9 miles, he came to a fork, and chose to go right. The 6-year-old then second-guessed that decision, but his feet were bothering him to the point where he didn't want to retrace his steps. Instead, he decided to cross Howard Creek and continue to the other road, only to fall in and get wet. The remainder of his story involves two coyotes,  tunnel vision,  and a helpful teenager. All told, he walked somewhere between 14 and 20 miles and ended up with acute tendonitis so bad he was on crutches.

Trump inquires about the charge, and Gilman tells him,  Well you write it any way you like. Grand theft, fraud—I think the jury will find it's stealin'.  Mashable says the episode is  so on point  that during one exchange with Gilman, Trump threatens to sue him. A clip of the episode hit YouTube in November 2016 but has cropped up again on Twitter, for obvious reasons. Snopes confirms that the episode really aired. See it in full here.

Enter a 42-year-old woman from the UK, who, since one long-ago day when she was 14, had a contact lens lodged under the lid of her left upper eyelid without even knowing it. BuzzFeed reports on the odd case described in BMJ Case Reports, an event the journal describes as a  28-year trauma.  CBS Dallas-Fort Worth reports the woman had experienced a swollen and droopy eyelid for about six months, and when she finally went to get it checked out, an MRI scan revealed a cyst just above her left eye. Doctors went in to remove the cyst, and what was inside it puzzled them: There was a rigid gas permeable (RGP) contact lens embedded, a type of hard contact lens that predates the softer ones most people use today. As everyone scratched their heads as to why she would have this type of lens in her eye, her mother remembered that when her daughter was 14, she'd been slammed in the eye by a badminton birdie while wearing her contacts and suffered minor injuries that fully healed. They all just figured her lost contact had popped out and dropped to the ground when the birdie hit her face, and CNN notes she never wore RGP contacts again. Since the lens has been removed, the woman's more recent eye problems have dissipated. (This woman had 27 contact lenses stuck in one eye.)",

His family said in a statement that Fonda died Friday morning at his home in Los Angeles, per the AP. He was 79. The official cause of death was respiratory failure due to lung cancer.  I am very sad,  Jane Fonda said in a statement.  He was my sweet-hearted baby brother. The talker of the family. I have had beautiful alone time with him these last days. He went out laughing.  Born into Hollywood royalty as Henry Fonda's only son, Peter Fonda carved his own path with his non-conformist tendencies and earned an Oscar nomination for co-writing the psychedelic road-trip movie Easy Rider. He never won that golden statuette, but he was later nominated for his turn as a Vietnam veteran and widowed beekeeper in  Ulee's Gold.  Fonda was born in New York in 1940 to Henry Fonda and Frances Ford Seymour, a Canadian-born US socialite, who killed herself when Peter Fonda was just 10. Fonda produced Easy Rider and Dennis Hopper directed it for a meager $380,000. It went on to gross $40 million worldwide, a substantial sum for its time. He remained prolific for the rest of his life, with notable performances as the heel in Steven Soderbergh's The Limey, from 1999, and in James Mangold's 2007 update of 3:10 to Yuma. Although Fonda never achieved the status of his father or his older sister, the impact of Easy Rider was enough to cement his place in popular culture. Fonda had an estranged relationship with his father for most of his life, but he said that they grew closer over the years before Henry Fonda died in 1982. Fonda is survived by his third wife, Margaret DeVogelaere, as well as his daughter, actress Bridget Fonda, and his son, Justin, both from his first marriage to Susan Brewer.",

The 5-4 opinion, issued around 2am, determined inmates had  not made the showing required to justify last-minute intervention,  per the Washington Post. On Monday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan of the District of Columbia had blocked the Justice Department from carrying out the first federal executions since 2003, arguing legal challenges should be heard in court. Chutkan had also blocked executions in December, though the court of appeals later gave the green light. Early Tuesday, Supreme Court justices wrote that last-minute stays  should be the extreme exception, not the norm.  The opinion was issued shortly before Daniel Lewis Lee was scheduled to die by lethal injection at a federal penitentiary in Indiana. It's unclear if the execution was carried out as planned around 4am, per Reuters. Lee was convicted in 1999 of murdering an 8-year-old girl and her parents in Arkansas. But even the lead prosecutor and federal judge in the case disagreed with the execution. They described Lee as a follower of white supremacist Chevie Kehoe, who received a life sentence for the same crime. Relatives of one of the victims had sought to delay Lee's execution until it was safe for them to travel to the prison. They cited personal health issues amid the pandemic. But the Justice Department said it was not required to consider  the availability and travel preferences  of those wishing to attend.

Per NASA, the SDO stitched together 425 million high-res images into a 61-minute video, set to a soothing score by German musician Lars Leonhard, that depicts a full solar cycle—complete with developing sunspots, eruptions, and planets passing by. The SDO snapped a photo of the sun every 0.75 seconds, on average, with one of the instruments capturing a picture  every 12 seconds at 10 different wavelengths of light.  As for some parts of the video that seem amiss: NASA explains that at points when the sun seems off-center, the SDO instruments were recalibrating, while occasional dark frames (such as that seen at 53:29 in the video) were from the Earth or moon obscuring the light as they passed between the spacecraft and the sun. A slightly longer blackout in early August 2016 took place when there was a problem with one of the instruments, which was taken care of after about a week. Newsweek notes that the video comes out right before the European Space Agency releases the closest pictures of the sun ever taken, shot from the NASA-ESA Solar Orbiter, which got as close as 48 million miles away from the sun's surface.

To qualify for the funds, you need to be a full-time employee of an out-of-state business who works from home. The unusual proposal, which comes with a new law signed by Gov. Phil Scott on Wednesday, aims to add to Vermont's small and aging population of 625,000 at a time when a thriving US labor market is making it difficult to retain workers, reports CNN.  We recognize the need to recruit people to the state, and this is one of those efforts,  Joan Goldstein, the state's commissioner of economic development, says of the Remote Worker Grant Program, which will provide up to $10,000 over two years to full-time workers who relocate to the state but work remotely for an out-of-state employer. The funds are meant to cover the cost of moving, computers, internet, and other work-related expenses. Interested workers will want to act fast. The state has only budgeted for 100 grants to be given out over the next three years, on a first-come, first-serve basis beginning on Jan. 1, 2019, and Goldstein says her office is already receiving inquiries. That should please Scott, who notes the state has  about 16,000 fewer workers than we did in 2009,  per CNBC. He hopes a separate state program will also help. The Stay to Stay Weekends program aims to convince Vermont's 13 million annual tourists to settle in Vermont for good by offering networking events with employers, entrepreneurs, and realtors, across four weekends this year, reports Quartz. The second kicks off Friday.",

Benson was a Longhorn hero, scoring 64 rushing touchdowns over four seasons, 1,000 yards each season, and 5,540 yards overall, the ninth-best among college gridiron rushers.

Publicist Gwendolyn Quinn tells the AP that Franklin died Thursday at 9:50am at her home in Detroit. Franklin, who'd battled undisclosed health issues in recent years, had in 2017 announced her retirement from touring. A professional singer and accomplished pianist by her late teens, and a superstar by her mid-20s, Franklin had long ago settled any arguments over who was the greatest popular vocalist of her time. Her gifts were a multi-octave mezzo-soprano, gospel passion, and training worthy of a preacher's daughter. She recorded hundreds of tracks and had dozens of hits over the span of a half-century, including 20 that reached No. 1 on the R&B charts. But her reputation was defined by an extraordinary run of top 10 smashes in the late 1960s, from the morning-after bliss of  (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,  to the wised-up  Chain of Fools,  to her unstoppable call for  Respect.  Her records sold millions of copies and the music industry couldn't honor her enough. Franklin won 18 Grammy Awards. In 1987, she became the first woman inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame. In a 2004 interview, Franklin was asked whether she sensed in the '60s that she was helping change popular music.  Somewhat, certainly with 'Respect,' that was a battle cry for freedom and many people of many ethnicities took pride in that word,  she answered.  It was meaningful to all of us.",

Reuters notes that's only phase one, however, in Edwin Hardeman's case, with the cause of his cancer kept separate from potential liability by Bayer AG, which acquired Monsanto, the weed killer's maker, last year. The unanimous decision handed down this week by a federal court said Roundup was a  substantial factor  in Hardeman's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, moving the case into liability phase, where Hardeman's legal team will argue that Monsanto misled the public on glyphosate's health risks and should be held responsible, per the New York Times.  We feel confident ... a jury ... will see that Monsanto has committed 40 years of corporate malfeasance,  a Hardeman attorney says. This decision comes on the heels of last August's ruling that Monsanto must pay Dewayne Johnson $289 million, finding the weed killer contributed to his non-Hodgkin's lymphoma; per Reuters, that amount has since been reduced to $78 million and the case is in appeals. Bolstering Bayer's argument is the fact that regulators such as the Environmental Protection Agency and the European Chemicals Agency have ruled glyphosate isn't a likely carcinogen, though the World Health Organization disagrees and says it  probably  is.  We have great sympathy for Mr. Hardeman ... but an extensive body of science supports the conclusion that Roundup was not the cause of his cancer,  Bayer says in a statement.

Beaton, the mother of a 3-year-old son who was pregnant with a second child, was on her way to see a continuing care client when she was killed Sunday morning. Her husband says the province's failure to send out any emergency alerts doomed his wife. They didn't realize the gunman was wearing a Royal Canadian Mounted Police uniform and driving a police vehicle  until it was too late.   I would not have let my wife leave ... if I had that broadcast come across, that he was on the loose and he was driving an RCMP vehicle,  he says, per the CBC. He says the couple had been monitoring the situation Saturday night, but assumed it was under control by the following day when no alert was sent out, the Cape Breton Post reports. When he found out the gunman was still at large, he sent his wife a message warning her not to stop for anyone—but she was killed minutes later, never having had a chance to read it. Premier Stephen McNeil has been criticized for the lack of emergency alerts, but he says it's up to the RCMP to ask for such an alert and provide the details for it.  We had staff on hand in the morning to be able to do that,  he said.  But it was not requested.  Instead, the RCMP provided updates via Twitter. (The victims also included a mother, father, and their teen daughter.)",

In the declaration from the Alliance of World Scientists, published in the journal BioScience, the scientists warn that an  immense increase of scale in endeavors to conserve our biosphere is needed to avoid untold suffering due to the climate crisis.  The scientists set out  critical and interrelated  steps that should be taken in six areas: Energy, short-lived pollutants, nature, the economy, food, and, most controversially, population, NBC reports. They call for the stabilization of the world population through measures including making family-planning services available to all and working toward full gender equity in education. Declaration co-author William Ripple, a professor of ecology at Oregon State University, said they aimed to have the declaration endorsed by  a wide diversity of scientists in many different disciplines, because climate change has moved beyond a topic just for climate scientists.  One of the signatories was conservation biologist Sheila Colla, who studies bumblebees and other pollinators. Part of her work is  seeing how much is interconnected in terms of the land, our food, the wildlife that pollinates, that provides ecosystem services, and the climate,  she tells the CBC.

Just a couple of weeks after Zozo founder Yusaku Maezawa donated more than $18 million to a Japanese city hit hard by a typhoon, the fashion-minded entrepreneur is back in the news with yet another giveaway. Reuters reports that this time, Maezawa will pony up $9 million, to be distributed in $9,000 bundles to 1,000 lucky recipients, chosen at random after they retweeted his Jan. 1 Twitter post on the matter.  It's a serious social experiment,  Maezawa said in Japanese in an accompanying YouTube video, adding he hopes this initiative piques the interest of those in academia and economics. That's because Maezawa is curious on how the overall concept of universal basic income—an idea often floated by US presidential candidate Andrew Yang, in which a nation's citizens receive a regular, guaranteed payment—would affect people's overall well-being and happiness. An economist tells Reuters that what Maezawa is doing is somewhat different than the basic income idea: It's just a one-time payment to each recipient, and in Japan at the moment, people are still finding jobs in general due to a tight labor market. Still, Maezawa wants to see how his  winners  react.  What happens if someone who can't help themselves with their own power is given money ... to rebuild their lives?  he tweeted.

Reuters and the South China Morning Post report that UK judge Charles Haddon-Cave has ordered Russian oligarch Farkhad Akhmedov to sign over the 380-foot Luna to his 41-year-old wife as part of a $635 million divorce settlement Cave awarded her in 2016—nearly 42% of Akhmedov's fortune, and said to be the largest British divorce settlement of all time.

And it's some boat Akhmedova will soon be docking: a nine-deck expedition yacht with 50 crew members, two helipads, a 65-foot swimming pool, a mini-submarine, and even an anti-missile system. The new court order comes after Akhmedova says she never received any money from the settlement, with Cave noting it appeared the 62-year-old Akhmedov had taken  elaborate steps to conceal his wealth and evade enforcement of the judgment,  per the London Times. Akhmedov said he'd sold the yacht back in 2014, but it turned out the firm he'd sold it to was simply one of his own offshore companies, and Akhmedova's attorneys eventually tracked the yacht down in dry dock in Dubai, where it remains under court order.

Cheetahs are a vulnerable species, with only 7,500 left in the wild. They also have low genetic diversity owing to a mass die-off about 10,000 years ago. That's made breeding cheetahs in captivity rather difficult. Indeed, there hasn't been a successful birth through artificial insemination since 2003, reports Smithsonian. That's why biologists at the Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute opted to try IVF. And third time's the charm: After fertilizing eggs retrieved from a genetically valuable 6.5-year-old female at the Columbus Zoo with sperm from a male cheetah at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas, who proved a good genetic match, the eggs were successfully implanted in a 3-year-old surrogate, also at the Columbus Zoo, whose genetic line is overrepresented. The cubs—a male and a female who are nursing, per USA Today—were born Wednesday, about 90 days later, in a bit of a surprise.  Usually it takes many, many, many tries of a technique like this before it's successful,  SCBI biologist Adrienne Crosier tells Smithsonian.  This is a really big breakthrough for us ... where we can reproduce these individuals that are unable or unwilling to breed naturally  to maximize genetic health, she says, noting the donor female has yet to give birth and  was unlikely to breed on her own.  A third of cheetahs in captivity are unable to breed due to factors such as age, health, and behavior, per CNN. Yet  this is the science that could save that species in the wild,  says Suzi Rapp of the Columbus Zoo. And perhaps not only cheetahs.

Javier Garcia allegedly entered the Sears store at the Woodfield Mall in Schaumburg, left without purchasing anything, then returned in his SUV four minutes later and crashed through the glass and steel store entrance, the New York Times reports. He then allegedly proceeded to drive through the mall causing chaos and panic—nearly hitting a children's train attraction, smashing glass, and striking kiosks—until the SUV hit a pillar and two off-duty officers pulled Garcia from the vehicle. Three people were taken to the hospital and four were treated at the scene, but no one sustained life-threatening injuries; damage to the mall, however, clocked in at more than $110,000. Police say Garcia, who is also charged with criminal damage to property, acted alone. They say he had searched for aerial views of the mall 124 times in less than a day, but that they have no reason to believe he was targeting any particular person or store and have not yet determined a motive. Police say the terrorism charge is defined under state law as  any act that causes substantial damage to any building containing (5) or more businesses of any type,  per CBS Chicago, but CBS News notes such a charge is  unusual  and that it's  not clear  why it was chosen. Garcia's lawyer calls the charges  aggressive and surprising,  and says he believes his client, who lives with his father and sister, was being treated for schizophrenia, paranoia, and bipolar disorder.  He is not a terrorist,  the attorney says.  He has zero criminal background. He’s been very cooperative, quiet and not aggressive.",

The upshot is that antibodies were found to persist in some people for at least four months after they contracted the coronavirus, per the study published Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. Researchers arrived at that conclusion by looking for antibodies in blood samples taken from 30,576 people in Iceland and then zeroing in on 487 people who took more than one antibody test. Those tests showed that the level of antibodies rose during months one and two and then plateaued in months three and four.  There is no evidence of any slight decrease,  says study co-author Dr. Kari Stefansson. One comment NBC News got on the findings from an infectious diseases expert:  What they're seeing here is that they're inducing a pretty strong immune response.  There was some nuance to that response. Antibody levels were higher in men versus women ( who tend to become less sick than men,  per the study), among nonsmokers versus smokers, and in older patients. But one sticking point: Of the blood samples that came from people who tested positive for COVID, the study found not all of them showed the presence of antibodies. The researchers speculate that those diagnoses were false positives, or that those with weaker immune responses just might not develop antibodies. And then there's the even bigger question: Do those antibodies actually protect a person against reinfection? An accompanying editorial notes that the study's focus on a  homogeneous population  means further research is needed, but  this study provides hope that host immunity to this unpredictable and highly contagious virus may not be fleeting and may be similar to that elicited by most other viral infections.",

Mounir el-Motassadeq, convicted of being an accomplice in the US attacks, is being deported to his native Morocco, the BBC reports. He had served almost 15 years in prison, nearly his entire sentence. He was being transported under heavy security, and was accompanied by several police officers on his commercial flight to Morocco, but once he gets there it's not clear what will happen to him. Motassadeq was friends with Mohammed Atta, who allegedly flew one of the hijacked planes on 9/11, and other members of the Hamburg cell of al-Qaeda that orchestrated the attacks, but he has long denied involvement. Deutsche Welle has an extensive look at the cell and how Motassadeq got involved. Motassadeq, who arrived in Germany to study engineering at age 19, admitted to the aforementioned friendships as well as to having spent time at an Afghanistan al-Qaeda camp in 2000; he also signed Atta's will. After investigators found that he had power of attorney over a bank account owned by one of the other alleged 9/11 pilots and that he had arranged a bank transfer for some of the cell members who underwent flight training in the US, prosecutors labeled him as the cell's treasurer. He maintained, over five years of trials involving convictions, appeals, and overturned verdicts, that he was simply doing favors for his friends and had no knowledge of the impending attacks. He was ultimately found guilty of membership in a terrorist organization and being an accessory to murder, and received the maximum sentence. He was released early in exchange for agreeing to be deported, the AP reports. He can be arrested if he ever returns to Germany. (Under the World Trade Center, a  poignantly defiant  rebirth.)",

They caused a big threat to the World Heritage Site by preying on native birds, bugs, and plants, and the five-year effort to do away with them got an assist from the public, with the  Million Mouse Project  fundraising campaign bringing six figures. The Department of Conservation explains that cereal bait laced with rodent toxin was dropped via helicopter on the island during the winter of 2016. A team scoured the island last month looking for any mice and found none.  This is huge news for conservation both in New Zealand and internationally,  says New Zealand Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage. She says more than two dozen types of birds, 21 uncommon plants, and more than 150 insect species will benefit. Both Radio New Zealand and NPR note the mice originally found their way to the Antipodes either on 19th-century ships or via a shipwreck and proceeded to purge the island of at least two insect species, as well as to displace some seabirds to other islands. The initiative in the Antipodes isn't a stand-alone: The island nation has also gotten rid of other invasive species in the name of boosting biodiversity, including goats, rats, cats, rabbits, and a local meat-eating weasel.

That's because the agency's guidance advises that states would be allowed to count their existing payments toward the $100 matching payment they're to make under the plan, CNN reports. In announcing his plan Saturday, Trump called it a $400-per-week payment, though the federal government's $300 would only kick in if the states commit to another $100. Already dealing with their own financial problems, many states said they can't afford that. The department said Sunday that states can figure in their current payments.  This option requires no new expenditures of state funds beyond what the state would already be paying out from state funds in regular unemployment compensation benefits,  an email said. For that matter, Trump's plan, which bypasses Congress, could be derailed in the courts; it was called  absurdly unconstitutional  by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.  I don't see how anyone actually realizes this benefit absent the Department of Labor or FEMA finding some loophole in the current legal structure,  said an analyst at the National Employment Law Project. Gov. Mike DeWine said Ohio won't be adding $100 in new money, but the state does plan to take the federal government's $300 if it can shift current payments. That still would hold the additional money to $300, per the Columbus Dispatch. Either way, it's not close to the $600 provided under the pandemic relief legislation that expired in July.

That includes, USA Today reports, the possibility of  no vaccine availability or herd immunity.  In fact, the study found, everyone should  be prepared for possible periodic resurgences of disease  over as long as two years. The University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy produced the study, with the help of pandemic experts from Harvard and Tulane universities. They analyzed data from this outbreak and eight major influenza pandemics, starting in the 1700s, per CBS. Seven of the influenza pandemics had a second significant peak about six months after the first, and some of them had  smaller waves of cases over the course of 2 years.  This pandemic probably will last 18 to 24 months, the authors said, partly because of the time it takes for 70% of the population to develop immunity—the level they say will be needed to achieve herd immunity. The report detailed three possible scenarios: a major resurgence of infections, worse than the current crisis, before the end of the year; a resurgence, followed by a series of smaller waves into next year; and a  slow burn,  with no pattern evident in the transmission of the coronavirus. The third possibility hasn't occurred in the other pandemics. But  the virus caught the global community off guard, and its future course is still highly unpredictable,  the report says.

Well, more than some: It has at least 3,100 signatures—not quite 5% of the workforce—and implores Pichai to withdraw the company from Project Maven. That's a Pentagon program focused on using artificial intelligence to analyze drone footage, and the New York Times reports it could increase the precision of drone strikes. The Times sees this fight as a sort of bellwether for what's to come as AI advances developed in Silicon Valley are more frequently put to use by the military.  We believe that Google should not be in the business of war,  states what Fast Company calls a  fiery  letter. The employees write that they want the company to turn that sentiment into policy by pledging to never  build warfare technology.  Though Google says the company's role in Project Maven is limited to  non-offensive purposes,  the letter states that  the technology is being built for the military, and once it’s delivered it could easily be used to assist in  tasks like launching weapons. The Times makes the argument that the publicity around the contract—first revealed in March by Gizmodo—could hamper Google when it comes to the ultra-competitive recruitment of AI researchers, who might find the military connection off-putting. That said, Amazon and Microsoft also have Pentagon contracts, but the letter-signers write that those companies' military work  doesn't make this any less risky for Google. Google's unique history, its motto Don’t Be Evil, and its direct reach into the lives of billions of users set it apart.  (AI researchers make  startling  salaries.)",

Research out of England has found parallels between human teens and their parents and adolescent dogs and their owners when it comes to an uptick in conflict. It's potentially something dog owners subconsciously know: Co-author Dr. Lucy Asher of Newcastle University tells the Guardian that once dogs hit puberty, there tends to be a jump in the number taken by their owners to shelters. What's going on, per Asher: The study found dogs who were 8 months old—in the midst of adolescence—were tougher to train and more likely to disregard their owners' commands as compared to 5-month-olds. The behavior was exaggerated in dogs who had shakier attachments with their owner. A press release calling the study  the first to find evidence of adolescent behavior in dogs  explains the research involved 69 Labradors, golden retrievers, and cross breeds of the two at the aforementioned ages. They found that the adolescent dogs were more likely that the younger ones to listen to  sit  commands from strangers—but more likely to repeatedly ignore the command from their owners. A similar pattern was repeated when the trainability of 285 Labs, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, and crossbreeds was rated by their owners and trainers. The trainers found that between 5 and 8 months, the dogs' trainability increased, while owners rated that period as a less trainable one compared to ages 5 and 12 months—i.e., outside adolescence.",

Michigan factory worker Geraldine Doyle, who died in 2010, was long thought to have been the woman in a bandanna working at an industrial lathe in a photo that inspired artist J. Howard Miller. But after years of sleuthing, scholar James Kimble discovered that the photo was actually of Fraley, then 20 years old, working at a turret lathe in the machine shop of the Naval Air Station in Alameda, Calif., in 1942, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the New York Times reports.  Pretty Naomi Parker looks like she might catch her nose in the turret lathe she is operating,  says the original caption of the photo obtained from a vintage dealer by Kimble, who stresses that Doyle made an honest mistake when she thought she recognized herself in the photo, which can be seen here. Fraley worked at the plant with her younger sister, patching airplane wings, drilling—and riveting. Fraley, who kept the photo after the war and was shocked to see somebody else's name on the displayed image when she visited the Rosie the Riveter/World War II Home Front National Historical Park for a reunion of war workers in 2011, told People in 2016 that she didn't care about fame, but that she was glad to have the record set straight.

Gov. Jerry Brown gave his stamp of approval Wednesday to a measure pushing California's primary up to the beginning of March, three months earlier than its contest in 2016, when Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump had already captured the major parties' nominations.  The Golden State will no longer be relegated to last place in the presidential nominating process,  says Secretary of State Alex Padilla.  Candidates will not be able to ignore the largest, most diverse state in the nation as they seek our country's highest office.  Bumping the primary up is designed to give the nation's most populous state more sway in choosing the Republican and Democratic nominees. And it could seriously shake up the nominating contest.  With all due respect to our brothers and sisters in Iowa and New Hampshire, California is the beating heart of the national resistance to Trump,  said Eric Bauman, chairman of the California Democratic Party, per the AP.  When it comes to deciding the Democratic nominee, our voices need to be heard early in the process.  The measure puts the state's primary on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in March.

Only recently have stories told by the survivors of rape shined a light on the price of this brutality—a thing that  ruined our hearts, our bodies, even our intelligence, our ability to think,  says one woman who was raped next to her baby (who was eventually killed) during the Rwandan genocide in the 1990s. In a lengthy feature, Jina Moore reports that when five women stepped forward to tell their stories at the United Nations International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania in 1997 (two have since died), they didn't realize that they were about to change the world.  We were only supported by the truth,  as one put it. But their stories helped establish rape as a crime against humanity, and even as a form of genocide. The story doesn't stop there. The court had defined sexual assault as being about power, not about sexual gratification (one woman was raped by so many men she died during the ordeal), but the women found themselves in another fight over power, and this time against the UN itself. As Moore reports, a UN judge attempted to block a new documentary (The Uncondemned) detailing the women's stories and the implications of the court's decisions elsewhere in the world. The court says it worried about witness protection because the film discloses their identities, but the three surviving women all signed agreements permitting the use of their real names. Read the full story, which delves into the complicated fight over the movie but mostly centers on the lives of the three surviving women.",

The award from a Los Angeles Superior Court jury fell short of the $30 million the legendary producer sought in the lawsuit filed nearly four years ago, but well above the approximately $392,000 the Jackson estate contended Jones was owed.

Although this (judgment) is not the full amount that I was seeking, I am very grateful that the jury decided in our favor in this matter,  Jones wrote.  I view it not only as a victory for myself personally, but for artists' rights overall.  Estate attorney Howard Weitzman says he and his team are surprised and disappointed by the verdict. He says the estate plans an appeal. Jones claimed in the lawsuit that Jackson's estate and Sony Music Entertainment owed him for music he had produced that was used in the concert film This Is It and two Cirque du Soleil shows that used Jackson's songs. The lawsuit said the entities had improperly re-edited the songs to deprive Jones of royalties and production fees.",

Per Lieber, about 400,000 US girls throw these bashes each year, with the average price tag coming to as much as a small wedding ($15,000 or so). But vendors aren't complaining, with DJs, caterers, florists, dressmakers, and event planners all cashing in on the boom that  quinceanera guru  Hilda-Gabriela Hernandez says started three or four years ago.  The quinceanera market is now monstrous,  she says, noting if you do your homework, you can bring in the big bucks by specializing in just this niche. And it's one that most other Americans traditionally haven't paid attention to, giving Latino business owners a chance to shine. Lieber also talks about how the current political climate is affecting the quinceanera's fate—Hernandez thinks people feeling insecure about their futures may start scaling back. But while some families actually go into debt to pay for the party, it's so important as a bonding experience that  patrons  will often chip in and split up paying for the big day.

The ruling noted that even though Apple's 2011 complaint accused Samsung of ripping off the look of the iPhone for its own devices (including the  rectangular front face with rounded edges ), as well as how the grid that shows app icons is presented, Apple couldn't collect on damages on total profits Samsung took in for its phones overall (Apple had originally been awarded more than $1 billion by a jury in 2012, but that number was whittled down.) And it all came down to three words, per Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the court's 8-0 opinion, per Reuters, which notes the high court almost never hears design patent cases. According to Section 289 of the US Patent Act, the  article of manufacture  term used in patent law is meant to cover both the entire product that a consumer can buy, as well as individual elements, or components, of that product. The ruling points out that when an item is just one component (e.g., a dinner plate), it's easy to apply this law, but for a multi-component item such as a smartphone, it becomes trickier. The Supreme Court disagreed with the appeals court's ruling that the smartphone as a whole was the only way  article of manufacture  could be interpreted, instead deciding that design infringement (and therefore damages) could be parsed into separate components. The Supreme Court's decision overturned the appeals court's ruling for $399 million awarded to Apple, but Fortune notes the case is now being sent back to the lower court to decide how much Apple's patents really merit.

The woman was hospitalized in August last year after she returned from an extended trip to India. Doctors discovered that she was suffering from a carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infection, which she had apparently contracted after being treated for a broken right hip in India, the Las Vegas Review-Journal reports. She died of septic shock, and testing showed the bacteria was resistant to all 14 kinds of antibiotics the hospital had on hand, per the medical website Stat. Even more alarmingly, later tests revealed that none of the 26 antibiotics in America would have worked.  I think this is the harbinger of future badness to come,  Dr. James Johnson, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Minnesota, says. He notes that while this is—for now—a very rare case, it's hard to believe nobody else in the country is carrying the same strain of CRE. Johnson says people often ask him:  'How close are we to the edge of the cliff?' And I tell them: 'We're already falling off the cliff.'  The hospital where the woman was treated says it didn't notify the public at the time. No further cases of antibiotic-resistant CRE have been identified, according to the CDC report, which stresses the importance of slowing the spread of such bacteria, and of finding out when patients have been treated in facilities outside the US.

The daily presidential tracking gauge notes that Trump's thumbs-up numbers peaked at 59% just after when he took office, stayed in the 50s for a while, and then fell below the halfway mark in early March, where they've remained since, with a low of 42%. But Chris Cillizza writes for CNN that one lone poll shouldn't be considered gospel on how Trump's doing, citing other recent polls such as Gallup's April 15 poll (41% approve, 53% disapprove) and Marist's April 14 poll (39% approve, 49% disapprove). Cillizza adds there may be reasons not to put too much stock in Rasmussen's results, although he's careful not to say that Rasmussen is necessarily wrong. He simply notes that there are some uncertainties surrounding the group's polling methodology, including how they define  likely voter,  how using automated interview software instead of real people may affect outcomes, and even whether the way the numbers are dialed serves up a truly representative sample. What Cillizza does say correlates: Trump's numbers jump with his strike on Syria. Meanwhile, another Monday Gallup poll shows 45% of Americans think Trump has been keeping his promises—a sharp drop from 62% in February. (A different February poll pitted Trump against generic Democrats in the 2020 race.)",

The baby boy was delivered via a planned Caesarean section in late November at Baylor University Medical Center at Dallas; the historic birth was announced Friday.  We've been preparing for this moment for a very long time,  uterus transplant surgeon Dr. Liza Johannesson says. Baylor has completed eight uterus transplants as part of an ongoing clinical trial, but at least three have failed. The unidentified woman was the first to give birth with a transplanted uterus in the US and only the ninth woman in the world to do so, according to the Dallas Morning News. Multiple surgeons at Baylor report crying during the birth.  It gives hope to women who didn’t feel like they had hope,  says Dr. Colin Koon, a member of the transplant team. The women in the clinical trial have absolute uterine factor infertility, which means their uterus doesn't work or isn't there, and many had grown up without hope of giving birth. Doctors say the uterus transplant procedure could also one day help women with other medical complications, such as cancer-related hysterectomies, give birth.  I have family members who struggled to have babies, and it’s not fair,  36-year-old Taylor Siler tells Time.  I just think that if we can give more people that option, that’s an awesome thing.  Siler donated the uterus that made last month's historic birth possible. The first attempt at a uterus transplant birth in the US failed due to a fungal infection last year at the Cleveland Clinic, WFAA reports.",

It had been put back to work during World War I in 1917, but was no match for the gigantic passenger ship. Now, a century later, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Coast Guard have announced that they found the wreckage 150 miles northwest of Los Angeles during a routine survey, reports the AP. While all on board were rescued that day, the Guard paid homage to the ship and its crew. A remotely operated vehicle caught footage of what remains of the ship last fall—mainly a steel skeleton covered with white anemones, reports Live Science. Historic photos helped researchers match the 11-foot bronze propeller and other features. While sea life has eaten away at the ship's hull and decks, a six-pound gun is still mounted at the starboard bow. The ship will likely be left alone, due in part to the US Sunken Military Craft Act of 2004, which prohibits disturbing or moving any part of the vessel. A Coast Guard commander calls the ship  a symbol of hard work and sacrifice of previous generations to serve and protect our nation.

Foxconn CEO Terry Gou discussed the potential expansion Sunday during a company meeting in Taiwan, the AP reports. Gou, whose company bought Japan's Sharp Corp last year, said a decision would depend on factors including whether a state where the factory might be built would be willing to provide low-cost land or power.  If American state governments were willing to provide these terms and we calculate it is cheaper than shipping from China or Japan, why shouldn't Sharp build a factory in the United States?  Gou said. Gou said investment would  exceed $7 billion  and the facility, if built, would employ 30,000 to 50,000 people. He said Pennsylvania is a leading candidate, but Foxconn is in discussions with other states, too. Foxconn, founded by Gou in 1974, assembles smartphones and other devices for Apple, Sony, BlackBerry, and other brands. Most of its operations are in mainland China, where its vast factories employ more than 1 million people.

The car company is experimenting with a modern twist on car ownership: Don't own at all and instead try out a new vehicle every month or close to it. In a press release, the company says it launching a  subscription  month-to-month car service it's calling BOOK. Those who participate can drive a new model for up to 60 days before turning it in, and they can max out at 18 different cars a year. It's not cheap, however, at $1,500 a month.  BOOK is aimed squarely at Gen X and Y customers who want the experience of a luxury vehicle without the hassles of traditional ownership,  a company executive tells Vocativ. BOOK debuts Feb. 1 in the New York City metro area, where car ownership rates are falling and people might want to take different members of a fleet out and about at their leisure without having to worry about selling it down the road, reports Quartz. Leasing a Cadillac costs much less—figure between $300 and $750—but with no mileage limits, and no handling of registration, taxes, maintenance, or insurance (though there is a $750 deductible in the event of an accident), the company is hoping the service paves the way for car subscriptions and finds success in other US markets, like Los Angeles.

Soules told the dispatcher that he  rear-ended a guy on a tractor  with his pickup truck Monday night on a road near the northern Iowa town of Aurora, according to a recording of the call released Wednesday. Soules, who appeared on the hit ABC reality show two years ago, said the man had been thrown into a ditch, wasn't conscious, and didn't appear to be breathing. He told the dispatcher that he didn't know CPR, and he could be heard asking others who were there if they did. The audio then indicates that someone tried to perform CPR on the man, but it's unclear whether it was Soules. Soules said the man had a pulse and had blood coming from his mouth. The six-minute call ends when Soules asks whether he can call back and hangs up. The tractor driver, a 66-year-old local farmer named Kenneth Mosher, was later pronounced dead at a hospital. Authorities say Soules left the scene in another truck—it's unclear who was driving—before emergency responders arrived. He was arrested about five hours later at his farm in nearby Arlington; Assistant Buchanan County Attorney Jenalee Zaputil said Soules refused to leave his home and it took hours for police to get a search warrant to go inside and arrest him. He was booked on a charge of leaving the scene of a deadly crash and released on bond hours later. Buchanan County Sheriff Bill Wolfgram said investigators are trying to determine whether alcohol or speed were factors in the crash. He also said they are trying to identify the person who picked up Soules and that this person could be charged, depending on the circumstances.",

The truth was even worse. When her husband rushed home from work to help look for twins Nishant and Nakshya (the parents even began scanning CCTV footage taken outside the house in case of a kidnapping), he ultimately found them stuck head-down in their top-loading washing machine, which had filled with enough water to drown them both. They were rushed to the hospital, but they'd been without oxygen for too long. While officers have found no evidence of foul play, an inquiry into the boys' deaths is likely, and their bodies are being autopsied, reports the Indian Express. It appears that the boys, who'd just been undressed for a bath, climbed onto the pile of clothes next to the washing machine, peered inside, and fell head-first into the small space, unable to move or escape.  They came into this world naked, they have left naked,  their grandmother mourns. The couple have a 10-year-old son who was at school during the tragedy, reports the Independent.

This is a very complex situation that they found themselves in, and a pretty tough firefight,  Dunford said. Four American troops and five Nigerien soldiers were killed Oct. 4 when they were ambushed by around 50 militants armed with machine guns and rockets.

For reasons that Dunford says are unclear, the French jets didn't initially attack the militants, though French helicopters and Nigerien reinforcements joined the fight later in the day. The slain Americans were part of a group of 12 US troops and 30 Nigeriens on a routine patrol to the remote village of Tongo Tongo, the Washington Post reports. They were ambushed after leaving the village, having spent the night there. Dunford said the investigation will look into whether their objective changed at some point, whether they had adequate communications, and why the body of Sgt.

At the time, that murder was linked to the brutal killing one month earlier of Gertie Jensen, 31, in Gothenburg. Swedish sleuth Bo Lundqvist confirmed to the newspaper that Malmö cops told UK authorities in 1981 that the truck driver may have been in the city around the time of the murders. That lead went nowhere after Interpol reported—wrongly, it turned out—that Sutcliffe was not there. Interpol later corrected that version in a telex that apparently wasn't spotted by UK cops until last year, when a cold case squad took another look at the two unsolved murders. They have another major clue to pursue: a hair recovered from Thörling's body that could identify her killer. Lundqvist confirmed that UK cops have asked his department for help.  They wanted answers,  he tells Kvällsposten, including forensic evidence and  whether Sutcliffe was named in any investigations.  Sutcliffe was diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia, per the Guardian, after being sentenced to life in prison in 1981 for the murders of 13 women in the UK in the late 1970s, and the attempted murders of seven others. Although the statute of limitations has lapsed for the two murders in Sweden, Sutcliffe could be prosecuted under UK law. (A letter reopened a very old case.)",

An equivalent amount will be shaved off non-security spending for the budget year starting Oct. 1; law enforcement and veterans may also see additional funds come their way. The Washington Post reports that while few specifics have been released, officials did name foreign aid as being subject to  large reductions ; the paper points out that makes up one of the more minor parts of the federal budget. How the Office of Management and Budget official that briefed reporters put things, per Politico:  This budget expects the rest of the world to step up in some of the programs this country has been so generous in funding in the past.  Individual agencies can push back on recommendations with proposed changes. The OMB will pen the official fiscal 2018 request, which then goes to Congress in mid-March. The upshot for the AP: Trump's first pass won't reduce what is projected to be a budget deficit of $500 billion, and things will likely get ugly:  Democrats and some Republicans are certain to resist the cuts to domestic agencies, and any legislation to implement them would have to overcome a filibuster threat by Senate Democrats. A government shutdown is a real possibility.

The final entry on the list read,  A man lives the same day over and over.  After the No. 2 idea on Rubin's list got sold and made into Hear No Evil starring Marlee Matlin, an agent wanted another script, and Rubin chose that No. 10 idea—which became Groundhog Day. Why did Rubin choose to center the movie around a holiday, which he decided to set on Feb. 2? He was hoping, as S.I. Rosenbaum explains in an extensive piece for the New Yorker, that the film would become a  holiday cable perennial.  It worked. Rosenbaum traces the film's journey, from Rubin's first draft to the final draft, from the movie's initial modest success to its current cult status. Despite its insane popularity, Rubin never went on to have another hit. Hollywood people kept trying to get him to make another movie, but he didn't want to make just a standard rom-com, and he turned them all down.  I was always thinking, I’m not a one-hit wonder, I’m not a one-hit wonder!  he tells Rosenbaum.  But even if I am—OK, that’s more than most people get.  Then, in 2012, Rubin's own life began to resemble Groundhog Day when Tim Minchin and Matthew Warchus approached him about turning the film into a musical. They had to convince him they weren't going to ditch him along the way, and they didn't—Rubin has been a part of the entire process, which resulted in the beloved movie becoming a beloved musical.  I'm the guy who wrote Groundhog Day,  Rubin says, but he's not bitter about it.  It’s delightful to be so associated with something so well loved.  The full piece is worth a read.",

Hodgkinson, whose license for a home-inspection business was not renewed late last year, has had at least one prior brush with the law: About a decade ago, he was charged with battery and aiding damage to a motor vehicle in St. Clair County, Ill., reports the Washington Post. The charges were dismissed.  We may have our differences but we do well in times like these to remember everyone who serves in our nation's capital is here because, above all, they love our country. We can all agree we are blessed to be Americans,  Trump said, per Politico.  We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,  he added. Authorities say Hodgkinson opened fire on the field in Alexandria, Va., early Wednesday, with the first 911 call coming in a little after 7am EDT. Police say five people, including the shooter, required medical attention. One is House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who is undergoing surgery after being shot in the hip.  Prior to entering surgery, the Whip was in good spirits and spoke to his wife by phone,  his office said in a statement, per USA Today.

Over his 16 years at the country's helm from 1982 to 1998—first for West Germany and then for all of a united Germany—Kohl combined a dogged pursuit of European unity with a keen instinct for history. Less than a year after the November 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, he spearheaded the end of Germany's decades-long division into East and West, ushering in a new era in European politics. It was the close friendships that Kohl built up with other world leaders that helped him persuade both anti-communist Western allies and the leaders of the collapsing Soviet Union that a strong, united Germany could finally live at peace with its neighbors.  Helmut Kohl was the most important European statesman since World War II,  Bill Clinton said in 2011, adding that Kohl answered the big questions of his time  correctly for Germany, correctly for Europe, correctly for the United States, correctly for the future of the world.  Kohl's legacy includes the common euro currency that bound Europe more closely together than ever before. Kohl lobbied heavily for the euro, introduced in 1999, as a pillar of peace—and when it hit trouble more than a decade later, he insisted there was no alternative to Germany helping out debt-strapped countries like Greece.",

She was 89. Cook died early Tuesday of respiratory failure at her home in Manhattan, surrounded by family and friends, according to her publicist. Her last meal was vanilla ice cream, a nod to one of her most famous roles in She Loves Me. On Broadway, Cook was best known for three roles: her portrayal of the saucy Cunegonde in Leonard Bernstein's Candide (1956); librarian Marian, opposite Robert Preston in The Music Man (1957); and Amalia Balash, the letter-writing heroine of She Loves Me (1963). Yet when Cook's ingenue days were over, she found a second, longer career in clubs and concert halls, working for more than 30 years with Wally Harper, a pianist and music arranger. Born in Atlanta in 1927, Cook hated vocal exercises and never had a vocal coach.  I don't remember when I didn't sing. I just always sang,  she said in 2011.  I think I breathed and I sang.  Cook made her Broadway debut in 1951's Flahooley, a short-lived musical fantasy that became a cult classic, then turned to solo shows after her Broadway career withered in the late 1960s as she battled alcoholism and weight gain. She gave up drinking in the 1970s and, with the help of Harper, reinvented herself as a solo artist, working in small NYC clubs and finally Carnegie Hall. When asked what her advice usually was to aspiring singers, she once told the AP it boiled down to three words:  You are enough. You are always enough. You don't ever have to pretend to be anything other than what you are.  Her marriage to acting teacher David LeGrant ended in divorce. Cook is survived by son Adam LeGrant.",

That is, until a stunning act of sabotage left one winery soaked in thousands of gallons of vino. The Telegraph reports that employees at Conte Vistarino arrived at work one morning last week to find a massive spill of Chardonnay, Pinot Grigio, and other aging white wines. Vandals apparently broke into the 2,400-acre winery, opened the taps of refrigerated tanks, and drained the equivalent of 400,000 bottles, valued at $530,000.  It was a tremendous shock,  the owner, Countess Ottavia Giorgi di Vistarino, tells the newspaper. The culprits didn't steal anything of value, suggesting the act was pure sabotage.  Lo Scandolo,  writes the Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera. It turns out a wide-ranging corruption probe is underway of wine-makers in the rolling hills around Pavia, who are suspected of cutting their quality wines with inferior grapes to increase production. While prosecutors say the centuries-old Conte Vistarino winery is not suspected of wrongdoing, they are investigating around 300 others for crimes including bribery and falsifying documents. An export boom in Italian wines has led to a spike in competition and fears that organized crime may be involved. The Vistarino family had received no threats before about 10% of the estate's maturing wine stocks were drained. A few days earlier, the estate had paid local farmers for the grapes, which were destined to be sold to third-party producers of sparking wine.

Doctors told her parents to hold off on a funeral for her twin sister who had died at birth, expecting Horn too would soon be gone. But her life spanned nearly a century after her parents put their faith in a sideshow doctor at Coney Island who put babies on display in incubators to fund his research to keep them alive. Horn died Feb. 11 in New York at age 96, the AP reports. She had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Horn was among thousands of premature babies who were treated in the early 20th century by Dr. Martin Couney. He was a pioneer in the use of incubators who sought acceptance for the technology by showing it off on carnival midways and fairs. He never accepted money from the babies' parents, but instead charged oglers admission to see the tiny infants struggling for life. Couney, who is viewed today as a pioneer in neonatology, estimated that he successfully kept alive about 7,500 of the 8,500 children that were taken to his  baby farm  at the Coney Island boardwalk. There is no estimate on how many are still alive today. Horn worked as a crossing guard and then as a legal secretary for her husband. She said she met Couney when she was about 19 and thanked him for what he had done.  I've had a good life,  she said in 2015.",

And he hasn't. Politico reports the funding all relates to the State Department-based Global Engagement Center, an interagency entity that came into existence last year and is tasked with countering  disinformation  from ISIS and countries like Russia and North Korea. Legislation signed by former President Obama grants the center $60 million in funding from the Defense Department in this fiscal year and another $60 million in the next. But Tillerson has yet to ask the Pentagon to transfer the funds to State; he has until Sept. 30 to do so. As for the other roughly $20 million, Politico reports it's also earmarked for the center and is sitting untouched at State. (FP's take is slightly different, that a memo has to be sent to Congress to get that money.) Politico talks to myriad unnamed sources who read into the situation, with four storylines emerging: that in its five months under Tillerson, decision-making at State has moved at a molasses-like pace; that there is wariness about putting funding to use in a way that could further needle Moscow; that President Trump's desire to cut the department's budget has Tillerson tightening the purse strings; and that Tillerson has favored the advice of a small group of aides—State Department outsiders—when it comes to decision-making. FP has much more on the latter point.",

Plenty of people could identify that as a line from Bob Dylan's  Mr. Tambourine Man,  but how many know the man who inspired the song? As it turns out, his name was Bruce Langhorne, and the highly regarded session guitarist has just died at age 78, reports the AP. Langhorne collaborated often with Dylan, perhaps most notably on Dylan's 1965 album Bringing It All Back Home, and the New York Times calls him a pivotal figure in helping turn folk music into folk-rock music. Dylan once explained that he was inspired to write  Tambourine Man  after seeing Langhorne show up for a recording session in 1964 with a large Turkish drum adorned with bells. Langhorne, who was born in Tallahassee, Fla., but raised mostly in New York City's Spanish Harlem neighborhood, displayed skill at the violin as a child, but had to give it up when he lost two fingers and part of his thumb on his right hand in a fireworks accident at age 12. The mishap led to a distinct playing style on the guitar. He was a regular in Greenwich Village in the 1950s and 1960s, making a name for himself by playing with Joan Baez, Gordon Lightfoot, and others.

And that's what authorities allege Liu Yongbiao did more than 20 years ago. The Times of London reports Liu had been born into poverty in a rural area, and police say Liu and a second man allegedly came up with a way to get some money: rob guests staying in accommodations in the eastern city of Huzhou on the night of Nov. 29, 1995. A victim who tried to resist was bludgeoned to death, and in a bid to cover their tracks, police claim the men did the same to the guesthouse operators and their 13-year-old grandson. What makes the case especially eerie are the words found in the introduction to Liu's latest novel, The Guilty Secret, which Sixth Tone reports was published in 2010. In the intro, he reportedly tells readers about his planned follow-up, The Beautiful Writer Who Killed, and its plot: a number of people die at the hands of a female author ... who manages to sidestep authorities. It's not the only drama to flow from Liu, with the Guardian reporting the 53-year-old allegedly greeted the authorities who had come to collect him last Friday by saying,  I've been waiting for you here all this time.  Police had few things to go on at the time of the murders: the guesthouse's two unknown guests that night had Anhui accents, used towels, and left shoe prints, reports China Daily. Fingerprints found at the scene went nowhere, but advancements in DNA testing recently moved the case forward; investigators reportedly took a sample of Liu's blood last month.

An Imperial College London study published in the International Journal of Epidemiology has found that doubling the current suggestion to 10 servings a day could stave off 7.8 million early deaths annually if people followed the new formula, the BBC reports. The study also pinpointed specific fruits and veggies that may help prevent heart disease and stroke (including apples, citrus fruits, and the cruciferous family of broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage) and cancer (spinach, peppers, and carrots, among others). The health boost from these victuals may come from the  complex network of nutrients they hold,  says study author Dagfinn Aune. The mega-study examined 95 separate studies that covered up to 2 million people and examined tens of thousands of different types of disease cases and 94,000 deaths. Researchers found upping fruit and veggie intake to about 28 ounces a day (a 10-serving equivalent) was tied to a 24% reduced risk of heart disease, a 13% decreased risk of all cancers, and a 31% slashing of premature deaths. Sarah Toule, head of health info at the World Cancer Research Fund, says not to go bananas if you can't hit that magic 10 each day—simply start with the baseline of five servings and try to sneak in a few extra whenever you can, maybe by  swapping one of your naughty snacks for a piece of fruit,  she tells the Guardian.

Workers renovating the Garden Museum (once a medieval-era church) next door to the Archbishop of Canterbury's Lambeth Palace stumbled across a vault with 30 lead coffins. A closer look at the accompanying metal plates revealed that five deceased Archbishops of Canterbury, going all the way back to the early 17th century, were among those interred.  This is really astonishing,  a former chair of the UK's Heritage Lottery Fund tells the BBC, noting that one of the newly discovered church leaders was Richard Bancroft, who commissioned the English translation of the King James Bible. Per NBC News, builders were toiling away at the site one day in 2015 when they made their discovery. A hole was mistakenly cut through the floor near the altar, and when the workers lowered a smartphone on a stick into the hole, they spied a staircase leading to the tomb where the coffins rested. What really caught their eye, though: the red and gold archbishop's crown perched on top of one casket. Although historians knew archbishops had been buried in the museum when it was still a church, they thought all remains had been removed during an 1851 rebuild—and most had, save for the ones directly beneath the church's altar. Viewers will soon be able to peer through a glazed panel to see the steps to the vault, where the coffins will remain undisturbed.

Sixteen bison, including 10 pregnant cows, were moved 275 miles from Elk Island National Park near Edmonton to a remote valley of Banff National Park last week, reports the CBC. For 16 months, they'll remain under supervision in an enclosed pasture, but the goal is to have them roam free in a 460-square-mile area of the park beginning in summer 2018. Bison were last kept at the park in 1997, but a wild herd hasn't roamed in what is Canada's oldest national park for more than 130 years, per the Globe and Mail. Though ranchers are concerned that the animals could damage property or spread disease—the bison introduced to the landscape were screened for things like bovine tuberculosis—conservationist Harvey Locke expects few challenges.  We know from the archaeological record that bison were in this park for over 10,000 years  so  it's a native species in its native habitat,  he says. He adds the $6.4 million project involves  the righting of wrong  after hunters nearly eradicated wild bison, which once numbered in the tens of millions throughout the continent, in the 19th century. Banff's herd will ultimately become  one of only four plains bison herds in North America that would be fully interacting with their predators and shaping the ecosystem,  a project manager tells Reuters.

That high tolerance for risk is what led Vegas Dave to his current business of placing big bets on longshot sports results—and business is booming.

He placed the bet one week into the season, at 30-1 odds, and the payout is the  largest futures bet win in sports gambling history,  Mel Magazine notes. Oancea had to spread the bet around to 15 different Las Vegas casinos, because after winning big with sports futures bets before, no casino would allow him to place such a large bet in one go. He's banned from Westgate, Vegas' biggest sports book, and the MGM Grand, and he's limited at several other casinos.  Vegas loves losers but hates winners,  he says. Dave believes his win will likely never be replicated in sports betting, because no one else puts down so much money at such long odds.

Authorities say the overdose deaths occurred in the Texas cities of Abilene, McKinney, and Sulphur Springs, and in the Oklahoma cities of Ardmore, Hugo, Idabel, and Yukon. In each case, the seven people died within a month of filling the prescription provided by Diamond, the indictment states. One person filled a prescription for methadone in May 2013 and was dead two days later. In another instance, a woman only identified in the indictment by the initials T.H. filled a prescription in July 2014 for alprazolam, morphine, oxycodone, and zolpidem. She died 10 days after receiving the drugs. Diamond pleaded not guilty to the charges on Tuesday. He is due in court again on Friday for a detention hearing.",

So imagine the forensic scientist's surprise when 45 naturally preserved brains—shrunken to 20% to 30% their original size but with ridges still visible—were discovered in a mass grave in Spain. According to a study published in Science & Justice, the grave in La Pedraja contained 104 bodies of people shot and killed in 1936 during the Spanish Civil War. The mass grave is one of only a very few of the hundreds from the war that have been excavated. Only 16 of the bodies—and none of the preserved brains—from the La Pedraja grave have been identified. There are a number of reasons behind the  exceptional finding  of the preserved brains, including the weather and manner of death. CNN reports it was colder and more rainy than normal when the victims were executed. Bullet holes in the skulls allowed rain water to seep in, but the skulls themselves kept the acidic soil away from the brains. This aided a process called  saponification,  in which tissue turns soap-like. While most other body tissues decomposed, the brains were preserved. Also preserved: the heart of a single victim, which Serrulla says is unprecedented. The 45 brains—the largest collection of naturally preserved brains in the world—are being kept in a laboratory in Spain.",

A ban on the imports was instituted under former President Obama in 2014. ABC News explains the reasoning: Under the Endangered Species Act, the US can allow for such imports if there is evidence that the hunting actually bolsters the species' survival (elephants are on the endangered list). Officials from those two countries reportedly offered such evidence, though details weren't specified. The rule will cover elephants hunted in both countries through the end of 2018. The Humane Society shared its displeasure at the news:  This jarring announcement comes on the same day that global news sources report that Mr. Mugabe, Zimbabwe’s aging dictator, is under house arrest following a military coup. This fact in and of itself highlights the absurdity and illegal nature of the FWS decision to find that Zimbabwe is capable of ensuring that elephant conservation and trophy hunting are properly managed.  But ABC News reports the Federal Register notice on the topic that will be posted Friday says Zimbabwe has made strides on that front, such as creating a system that tracks the financial benefit provided by American hunters, who must pay hefty permit fees.

The plan commissioned by new DHS Secretary John Kelly calls for construction of walls and fences in three phases over more than three years to have the barrier ready by the end of 2020, starting with 26 miles of wall in Texas and California.

The leaked plan does not reveal what the wall would look like, or what is going to be done in mountainous areas where construction would be unfeasible. Large parts of the border, especially in Texas, are in privately owned land and the cost of acquiring it, through eminent domain or other methods, is one reason for the soaring cost estimate.

Now, the state of New York is fining the Niagara Falls Water Board $50,000 for the incident that Gov. Andrew Cuomo says was  inexcusable  and has tarnished the landmark's reputation around the world. In addition to the fine, the Niagara Falls Water Board must get state approval for all future discharges and complete mandatory retraining of all employees, WGRZ reports.  We can conclude the Niagara Falls Water Board is responsible for a number of operating deficiencies, which led to human errors and led to the black water discharge,  says the executive deputy commissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation. The Niagara Falls Water Board had blamed old equipment and a miscommunication between employees at the sewage plant for the unsightly discharge, the AP reports. But state officials say it happened because protocol wasn't followed.  To say, 'This is an old plant,' is baloney. This was operator error,  Cuomo says.",

And the company could pay even more—as much as $4 billion—if it can't come up with an acceptable fix for cars that can be repaired. The proposed settlement filed late Tuesday before Judge Charles R. Breyer in US District Court in San Francisco covers owners of some 75,000 Audi, Volkswagen, and Porsche cars with 3.0-liter diesel engines, the AP reports. Volkswagen has already agreed to a $15 billion settlement for some 500,000 smaller, 2.0-liter diesel engines. Under Tuesday's proposed class-action settlement, owners of older models from 2009-2012, which cannot be fixed to meet pollution standards, will be offered buybacks or trade-ins plus compensation ranging from $7,755 to $13,880, according to a statement from owners' attorneys. People with newer cars from model years 2013-16, which can be fixed, will get compensation of $7,039 to $16,114. That's if VW can come up with a fix approved by US environmental authorities by an agreed deadline. If not, buybacks could push the cost as high as the $4.04 billion laid out in court documents. The deal must still get court approval to take effect. (In January, the FBI arrested a Volkswagen executive.)",

The Jamaican great finished third in his final 100-meter race, with Justin Gatlin and Christian Coleman taking gold and silver Saturday at the world championships in London. In a tight finish, Bolt was punished for his slow start and Gatlin fought back to nip everyone at the line in 9.92 seconds. Coleman took silver in 9.94 seconds while Bolt got bronze in 9.95. Because of his doping past, Gatlin was booed before and after the race. It was an amazing turnaround for Gatlin, who was the Olympic champion in 2004 before Bolt emerged and won an unprecedented three straight 100-meter titles at the Olympics. Thirteen years later, Gatlin bounced back to win in the Jamaican's last individual race. In between, Gatlin's career was stopped twice for doping suspensions. Yet fighting controversy all the way since, he got perhaps his greatest gold at 35. And Gatlin knew what Bolt meant to the sport, bowing in admiration in front of him, even after beating him. Bolt didn't smile any less afterward.  It is just one of those things,  Bolt said, showing his carefree demeanor even in defeat.  It has been brilliant.",

Crueler still, while the disorder is highly rare it's also genetic, and as the Washington Post reports, it's  not unusual  for the disease to affect more than one child in a family (here are two examples). In the case of Les and Celeste Chappell, four of their 10 children had the diagnosis, and three have now died—all in July, over the course of three days, in the family's home in Springville, Utah. As the Post reports, Elizabeth, 19, and James, 15—who had had the toughest time—were being tube-fed. When the time came for Les and Celeste to do the same for Christopher, 20, they reflected on the experience of their other two children and decided not to—and they felt that choice should extend to Elizabeth and James. So on July 13, the feeding tubes were removed, medication was given to ease any pain, and the family begin to pray over a process they were warned could take weeks. Instead, Elizabeth died the next day, followed by James the next and Christopher the next. The three shared an obituary and an eternal resting place: The parents purchased three burial plots, each designed to hold two coffins. Les and Celeste will one day share one.

Should ongoing discussions in Salem materialize, voters would see a question on their general-election ballots asking if a 172-year-old ban on dueling by public officials—as in, the old-fashioned way of resolving fights—should be erased from the Oregon Constitution, reports the AP. The constitutional ban in question is Article II, Section 9, which says anyone who offers, accepts, participates in a  challenge to fight a duel ... or who shall agree to go out of the State to fight a duel, shall be ineligible to any office of trust, or profit.  The article was signed in 1845, almost 15 years before Oregon's statehood, when squabbles were still often resolved by duel even decades after Hamilton's death.  They decided that it would not be very civil if two members of the Legislature disagreed and then shot each other on the front steps of the provisional capitol,  GOP Sen. Brian Boquist said Wednesday during the bill's first committee hearing. Democratic Sen. Ginny Burdick jokingly called it  the bill I've been waiting all session for.  The sole public testimony came from Dan Meek, a Oregon Progressive Party rep, who opposes Boquist's proposal.  This resolution would allow the candidacies of persons who give or accept challenges to fight duels,  Meek wrote.  Also, there is a cost to removing obviously unenforced and unenforceable provisions in the Oregon Constitution, including the cost of processing and printing this resolution on millions of ballots and processing the results.",

The hurricane re-strengthened to Category 4 with maximum sustained winds near 130mph, reports the AP. The National Hurricane Center said Irma was expected to weaken but would remain a powerful storm as it moved through the Florida Keys and near the state's west coast. As of 5am EDT Sunday, the hurricane was centered about 40 miles south-southeast of Key West, and had sped up slightly, moving northwest at 8mph. Tens of thousands huddling in shelters watched for updates as the storm swung west, now potentially sparing Tampa as well Miami the catastrophic head-on blow forecasters had warned of for days. But those few miles meant St. Petersburg could get a direct hit, rather than its more populous twin across Tampa Bay. Neither city has suffered a major hurricane in nearly a century.

Rick Scott warned residents in evacuation zones Saturday that  this is your last chance to make a good decision.  About 6.4 million were told to flee. Forecasters said the greater Miami area of 6 million people could still get life-threatening hurricane winds and storm surge of 4 to 6 feet. Irma's course change caught many off guard and triggered a major round of last-minute evacuations in the Tampa area. Many businesses had yet to protect windows with plywood or hurricane shutters.",

The AP notes Putin has made such pronouncements before and not followed through. The meeting preceded a summit in the same location with the heads of Syrian allies Russia and Iran, as well as Turkey, which has backed the rebels.

But as the Wall Street Journal reports, only 13% of workers in the private sector today hold pensions thanks to the 401(k) revolution—and original proponents of the tax-deferred savings plans are now saying they may not be the best way for people to shore up for their golden years.  We weren't social visionaries,  says Herbert Whitehouse, an ex-J&J exec who was also an early 401(k) promoter. Not only are the plans—which let workers sock away pretax money—vulnerable to stock market declines (defined-benefit pensions are guaranteed payouts for life), they're also subject to costly manager fees. And Forbes notes that longer-lived retirees may need enough funds to last 30 years or more, making it even more critical that retirement cash can be stretched for the long haul. One economist says at first she'd tell workers they'd be set if they saved just 3% of their salary—but that was based on projected 7% annual investment returns, an overly optimistic calculation. Plus, per an Employee Benefit Research Institute researcher, only 61% of workers who could be saving for retirement are currently doing so. Based on Boston College calculations, 52% of US households are  at risk  of not being able to live comfortably during retirement. Not that 401(k) plans are complete failures: Advocates say if people start using an employer-offered 401(k) early enough, it can lead to substantial savings. Still, fixes are being proposed, such as mandated savings plans run by either employers or the government.

They have been paying for it with their lives ever since. An AP analysis of bird-killing programs at the New York City area's three major airports found that nearly 70,000 gulls, starling, geese, and other birds have been slaughtered, mostly by shooting and trapping, since the 2009 accident, and it is not clear whether those killings have made the skies safer. Federal data show that in the years after LaGuardia and Newark airports ramped up bird-killing programs, recorded bird strikes actually went up. Combined, the two airports went from an average 158 strikes per year in the five years before the accident to 299 per year in the six years after, though that could be due to more diligent reporting. At the seaside Kennedy Airport, which is on a major migration route and had a robust slaughter program before the Flight 1549 crash, the number of strikes has ticked up. Bird advocates say officials should find other, more effective ways to protect aircraft.  There has to be a long-term solution that doesn't rely so extensively on killing birds and also keeps us safe in the sky,  says a rep of GooseWatch NYC, suggesting better radar systems to detect problematic flocks.

Per a DHS document Reuters saw, the agency has pored over the  existing funds and resources  President Trump said would be tapped to pay for a wall along the country's border with Mexico, and it only came up with about $20 million—or $21.58 billion short of the $21.6 billion it's expected to take to erect a wall and accompanying fence along the entire stretch. The report, which DHS is said to have presented to congressional budget staff last week, notes that amount could get some signatures on contracts for wall prototypes, but it wouldn't cover breaking ground on any structures. Mic notes that, based on DHS estimates, the newly found reserves would pay for  one whole mile of wall ; the US-Mexico border spans about 2,000 miles, per CNBC. Trump's wall plans, spelled out in a January executive order, stated that the US would pay for the wall with government funds and that reimbursement would later come from Mexico (though Mexico has said repeatedly it won't be paying a cent). Fox News notes that Trump initially said the wall would cost just $12 billion; he said at the time that wall-building would begin in just  months.  That timeline may need to be tweaked as the president likely goes to Plan B for making up the shortage: asking Congress for the rest. Speaker Paul Ryan has previously indicated he'd work funding for the wall, which he estimates would cost between $12 billion and $15 billion, into the next fiscal year's budget.",

I am confident in this vision [and] confident that … if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could've mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it,  Obama told David Axelrod for the latter's  Axe Files  podcast, per CNN.  I know that in conversations that I've had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards, is the right one.  Although Obama said Hillary Clinton  performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances  in her run against Donald Trump, he added that her camp missed an entire segment of the population that it needed to speak to—notably, Americans still hurting from the recession. He also dug into Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other GOPers for instituting  a backlash  to Obama's vision, though he conceded McConnell's strategy was  pretty smart and well executed.  But despite what he points out as missteps, as well as the contentious nature of Election 2016, Obama stuck by the assertion he made 12 years ago.

Nurses and midwives met with her along the way, and before giving birth to son Earl Reese-Thornton Jr. on Dec. 2, 2013, things had been progressing well. The birth, she alleged in a lawsuit, was disastrous. Earl Jr. had to be revived after entering the world and suffered permanent severe brain damage due to lack of oxygen. The judge agreed Dr. Ata Atogho was at fault, with the verdict noting he left her room for extended spells, once to speak to his stockbroker for eight minutes; with fetal heart rate monitors indicating the baby was in severe distress, the doctor also should have performed a C-section but didn't. The $33.8 million Dixon and her child will receive as a result won't cost Atogho a penny. That's because he wasn't the one being sued; rather, the US government was, as it's liable for any injuries its medical employees cause, explains the Miami Herald. Not only does Dixon say Atogho never apologized, she also says he lied, something backed up by the testimony of a nurse who noted Atogho wrote  refused c/s  [that's C-section] in Dixon's medical records; on the contrary, the nurse testified she yelled,  Just cut me.  Local 10 reports the judge in his order cited a defense expert who says the child will live only nine to 12 more years.

Thousands of fans lined the streets of Macon to honor the  Ramblin Man,  who was carried into Rose Hill Cemetery as a bagpiper played a somber tune.

Mourners, including Allman's ex-wife Cher, filed into the peach-colored building as five black stretch limousines waited outside for the short trip to the cemetery.

Born in Nashville, Tennessee, Allman was raised in Florida by a single mother. Allman idolized his older brother, Duane, eventually joining a series of bands with him.

Jerry Brown holds up as a model for states and nations looking to lower carbon emissions. Brown's signature will add another decade of life to the state's cap-and-trade program, bolstering the Democratic governor's quest to portray California as a leader in the fight against climate change at a time when President Trump is pulling back, per the AP. Brown portrays the initiative, which would have ended in 2020, as essential for the survival of civilization. Extending it has been one of his highest priorities as he nears the end of his fourth term, but critics say it fails to aggressively combat pollution. The legislation was fiercely opposed by some environmentalists who say it's too timid for progressive California, especially those who work to clean up the notoriously smoggy air in parts of Los Angeles, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the agricultural Central Valley. Conservatives also fought the measure, saying it will raise costs in an already expensive state. But Brown and Democratic leaders were able to cobble together the two-thirds support needed in both chambers to extend the law through 2030. Cap and trade puts a limit on carbon emissions and requires polluters to obtain permits to release greenhouse gases. Some permits, known as allowances, are given away while others are auctioned, generating billions of dollars in revenue for the state.",

As the Wall Street Journal reports, getting to nine figures would be an auction record for a painting by an old master—that is, a European who painted before about 1800. But not just any old master: Leonardo da Vinci. His  Salvator Mundi,  or the savior of the world, is one of fewer than 20 da Vincis known to exist, and all the others are held by museums. It's currently owned by Russian billionaire Dmitry Rybolovlev, who will likely be selling it at a loss. He bought it in 2013 for $127.5 million, and per his rep,  the forthcoming auction of this work will finally bring to an end a very painful chapter.  The pain he's referring to relates to Rybolovlev's dealings with Swiss art dealer Yves Bouvier, who counted Rybolovlev among his clients. Bouvier himself had purchased the work privately for $80 million; the 60% increase in price spurred allegations of fraud and ongoing court cases. But the drama began before then, with what Christie's calls  the greatest artistic rediscovery of the 21st century.  It says it's known the painting belonged to both King Charles I of England and King Charles II, but the painting was lost from 1763 until 1900 when the work—which had  extensive repainting  over Jesus' face and hair—was purchased as a work attributed to one of da Vinci's followers. It sold at auction in 1958 for what Quartz reports was $60.

Elliot, who was next in line and in front of his unarmed cousin, fired multiple shots that brought the bear down at the boy’s feet. Elliot’s pump-action shotgun was filled with birdshot, which is typically used to scare, not kill, large animals like bears. Lucas, who was not present during the bear attack, says that two lucky conditions contributed to his son’s deadeye reaction. Elliot didn’t have a sling on his gun, so he was carrying it in a manner that allowed him to shoot quickly. And just one day before the incident, Elliot asked his father for permission to remove a plug from his gun that only allowed it three shots.  It’s not just a matter of skill or preparedness. It can happen to anybody and it can go wrongly,  Lucas Clark said. State Sen. Shelley Hughes praised Elliot's  bravery  on her Facebook page, where she also posted bear safety links.

Yellowstone officials euthanized the severely injured wolf after hikers found the animal suffering in the northern part of the park, near Gardiner, Mont., on April 11. The 12-year-old wolf that was killed was the alpha female of a group of wolves dubbed the Canyon Pack and a popular target of photographers, the AP reports. The park offered the initial reward after a preliminary necropsy found the wolf had been shot. The Montana group Wolves of the Rockies followed up with its own $5,000 reward. Park officials haven't said whether they have leads in their investigation into who killed the wolf, but Wolves of the Rockies President Marc Cook suspects that the wolf's killer was someone angry about the reintroduction of wolves to the park more than two decades ago.  People take matters into their own hands and feel they are above the law,  he says. Park officials also haven't commented on a motive for the wolf's killing, but many hunting outfitters and ranchers oppose the presence of the wolves, which now number about 100 in the park. Park officials say the dead wolf had at least 20 pups, of which 14 became yearlings. She was together with the same alpha male wolf for more than nine years.",

Authorities in the northern state of Para say Adam and Emily Harteau and daughters Colette, 6, and Sierra, 3, are being treated in the city of Breves for insect bites and dehydration after spending three days hiding in the jungle after leaving the boat, the Wall Street Journal reports. They say the family and their Volkswagen van were on a barge that was hijacked in a dangerous Amazon delta area by pirates who abandoned the vessel after seizing goods including the family's cell phones. Crew members were eventually able to call police, but the Harteaus had vanished by the time they turned up. Police say the Harteaus have told them they were worried about their safety so they hid in the jungle with some food and water—and the surfboard they had left the barge on. Villagers reportedly found them on the surfboard, initially thought to have been driftwood, and contacted a passenger boat that picked them up. Para Deputy Secretary of Public Safety Andre Cunha has told local media that he's not entirely sure why they left the boat, but they may have been worried about police because of the small amount of marijuana that was found in their van, the Los Angeles Times reports.

Cooke-Moore says she underwent genetic testing because both her mother and grandmother had cancer. The lawsuit claims Cooke-Moore was wrongly told the test showed she had the MLH1 gene mutation and Lynch syndrome. She says she was told by gynecologist William Fitts that she had a 50% chance of getting breast cancer and an up to 80% chance of getting uterine cancer. She says nurse practitioner Lori Johns recommended surgery based on the test results.

The government-run Carlisle Indian Industrial School was established in 1879 as a place to scrub Native American children of their  savage nature,  a process that involved forcing new names, clothing, and language onto them. More than 180 are buried in a graveyard there, and the Northern Arapaho are now reclaiming the three children that are theirs. This week, more than a dozen tribe members arrived on the former campus in Carlisle, Pa., from Wyoming to oversee the exhumation of 14-year-old Little Chief, 11-year-old Horse, and 9-year-old Little Plume—or, as the school insisted the latter be called, Hayes Vanderbilt Friday. The children arrived at the school in 1881 and will soon return to Fremont County, Wyoming, for burial. PennLive reports that the US Army, the Army National Military Cemeteries, and a number of anthropologists and archaeologists are carrying out the five-day exhumation, which began Tuesday. There's a big  X-factor,  one archaeologist tells PennLive, in that the children were interred in wooden coffins, making the condition of their remains unknown. The process is being approached with great care: no machines, just shovels, hands, and mesh screens designed to sift out the smallest pieces of coffin or bone. The dead, many of whom couldn't withstand outbreaks of tuberculosis or the flu, hail from 50 different tribes, and future exhumations are expected.

Not only have researchers discovered a highly organized type of farming in Fiji ants—who plant the seeds of fruit trees, fertilize and protect them, harvest the resulting fruits, and collect seeds for future plantings—but they report in the journal Nature Plants that the techniques date back 3 million years. Humans, by contrast, didn't begin to sort out how to plant and harvest crops until around 23,000 years ago, reports the Los Angeles Times. While farming has been observed in other species, including Yeti crabs that cultivate bacteria and sloths that grow algae gardens on their fur, this is the first time ants have been found to farm plants rather than fungus.  Ants are a lot smarter than we think they are,  one researcher tells New Scientist.  We call them superorganisms because they form networks that are much like our brains. The information flow among ant colonies is just insane compared to human social systems.  The researchers out of the University of Munich in Germany say they discovered that ant colonies have been seen farming dozens of Squamellaria plants simultaneously, all connected through trails that link the thriving domatia, which are round, hollow structures they form at the base of the fruit trees in lieu of nests. What's more, it appears that the ants and trees have evolved to be co-dependent; without the trees, the ants starve, and without the ants, the trees no longer propagate.

We have been drinking the water for years and we had no idea, absolutely no idea,  Debbie Higgins tells the AP. Few residents even knew the half-acre plot on Rennie Farm was used from the 1960s until 1978 to dump carcasses from  tracer experiments,  in which scientists used radioactive compounds to see how things moved through life systems. A nearby site also contained human cadavers and stillborn fetuses used in medical classes. Dartmouth cleaned the site up in 2011, removing 40 tons of carcasses and soil from unlined pits that were legal at the time they were dug. That led to the discovery of hazardous waste and low-level radioactive materials and evidence that at least one chemical used in experiments, suspected carcinogen 1,4-dioxane, had leaked into groundwater. It was found to have contaminated the Higginses' well 800 feet away at twice the state standard.

The couple, trapped as flames surrounded their mountaintop Santa Rosa home, ended up spending six hours sheltering in the water as the fire raged around them, the Los Angeles Times reports. Jan, 65, says they tried to drive away but encountered a  wall of flames.  They fled to the pool when a 911 dispatcher advised them to shelter anywhere they could. John, 70, was initially reluctant to enter the cold water, but he jumped in after the flames ignited both the neighbors' home and a tree next to the pool. The Pascoes say they held each other all night in the pool, staying under the surface as much as they could to avoid flying embers and debris. When they emerged, they found that their home and the neighbors' home had burned to the ground—and a phone Jan had left in a sock next to the pool had melted. Santa Rosa is in Sonoma County, where authorities identified 10 of 17 victims Thursday, most of them in their 70s or 80s, the AP reports. Hundreds are listed as missing in what is already the deadliest fire outbreak in the state for at least 80 years. Authorities say the emergency is far from over, with 21 fires still burning and new evacuation orders still being issued. (In Napa County, a couple who'd been married for 75 years are among the wildfire victims.)",

In 2007, the Pentagon allowed the Afghan defense minister to pick expensive woodland-camouflage patterns from a private company rather than free camouflage schemes from the government, reports USA Today. This despite the fact that forest makes up only 2.1% of Afghanistan's land area. The revelation is in a newly released report from Afghan special inspector general John Sopko.  This is just simply stupid on its face,  he tells the newspaper.  If he thought pink or chartreuse was it, would we have done that?  A decade ago, US military consultants decided the Afghan army needed a more distinct uniform, in part to make it harder for the Taliban to stage attacks in counterfeit uniforms, reports the Military Times. The consultants showed then-Afghan defense chief Abdul Rahim Wardak pictures of  forest  uniforms they found on the internet, and he  liked what he saw,  according to the report. The Pentagon bought more than 1.3 million of the uniforms and 88,000 extra pairs of pants  without conducting any formal testing to determine the pattern's effectiveness for use in Afghanistan.  The report comes at a sensitive time: Afghan troops are in the midst of a multi-front conflict with both the Taliban and an ISIS offshoot, and earlier this month President Trump gave Mattis the authority to increase troop levels.",

Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt.

But officials have said the truck driver appeared to have crossed the center line. The witness, Jody Kuchler, a 55-year-old self-employed welder, tells the AP he and his girlfriend were driving home when he came across a truck that was driving erratically across the road.  He kept going off the road and into oncoming traffic and he just kept doing that,  says Kuchler. He says he followed the truck for at least 15 minutes and called the sheriff's offices for both Uvalde and Real counties, telling them  they needed to get him off the road before he hit somebody.  Kuchler says he witnessed the crash and afterward, he checked on both the bus and the truck and was able to speak with the driver of the truck, who has been identified as 20-year-old Jack Dillon Young.  He said, 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I was texting,'  Kuchler says.  I said, 'Son, do you know what you just did?' He said, 'I'm sorry. I'm sorry.'

The tank failures follow years of warnings that the Houston area's petrochemical industry was ill-prepared for a major storm, with about one-third of the 4,500 storage tanks along the Houston Ship Channel located in areas susceptible to flooding, researchers say. The tanks are prone to float and break during floods, and Harvey's unprecedented rainfalls revealed a new vulnerability when the roofs of some storage tanks sank under the weight of so much water. An expert notes the storm surge was small enough, though, that refineries seem to have avoided the huge spills tied to storms like Hurricane Katrina, when ruptured tanks released several millions of gallons of oil. The reports also say air pollutants such as benzene, toluene, and xylene were released into the atmosphere. Long-term exposure to such pollutants can cause cancer, although Texas officials say they never reached concentrations high enough in the storm's wake to cause health concerns. More massive storage tanks could be put to the test in coming days as Hurricane Irma bears down on Florida. Although Florida has no oil refineries, it has more than 20 petroleum product storage terminals in coastal communities and about 30 chemical companies with a presence in the state, including a significant number of facilities in the Tampa Bay area, per the American Chemistry Council and US Energy Information Administration.

An increase after President Trump's deal with Democrats to lift the debt ceiling by $318 billion leaves America $20.16 trillion in the red, up from around $19.84 trillion, CBS News reports. For comparison, Zillow estimates that the combined value of every house in the US is close to $30 trillion. Some $5.5 trillion of the debt is  intragovernmental debt  owed by one part of the government to another, with the rest held by the public. Michael A. Peterson, chief of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which calls for fiscally conservative policies, says passing the $20 trillion mark  is the latest indicator of our nation's dire fiscal condition,  the Hill reports. In a statement, Peterson warned that the growing debt will damage the economy and cost the government more than $6 trillion in interest over the next decade.  That's more than we will invest in our kids. So, in effect, we have decided to spend more on our past than on our future,  he said. (The debt is already bigger than the entire US economy.)",

CNNMoney reports Horizon Pharma's latest increase on Vimovo, which has seen nearly a dozen such rate rises since Horizon acquired it from AstraZeneca in 2013, amounts to a 9.9% increase on a 60-pill bottle, making the wholesale price $2,979. The high cost of the med—which FiercePharma explains is prescribed to help ease symptoms from certain forms of arthritis and to prevent gastric ulcers—is also raising eyebrows because its two main ingredients, naproxen (sold as the Aleve brand) and esomeprazole (commonly sold as Nexium), are sold separately for under $40.  Based on the mechanism of action of these drugs, I see no reason why these products can't be taken individually,  the CEO of a company that makes software to help ease drug payments tells the Irish Times. Horizon Pharma disagrees: It says taking the meds separately isn't the same as taking the combo pill; it adds there's no generic or OTC version of Vimovo. The company also pushes back on the steep price, noting it has rebates that allow all but 2% of insured patients to get the drug for less than $10 out of their own wallet. However, analysts say the price hike ends up raising insurance prices overall. It also underlies the murkiness of what happens when drug prices rise, as no one's really sure who's making money off the deal; besides the manufacturer, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers are also in the mix.

A spokesperson for UNHCR says 31 survivors of two shipwrecks who arrived on the southern Italian island of Lampedusa reported that the rubber dinghies they were traveling in had capsized Wednesday in heavy seas shortly after leaving Libya. The first dinghy—which carried around 140 people, including six children and about 20 women, some pregnant—sank when wooden planks laid at the bottom broke, causing the dinghy to capsize 25 miles off the Libyan coast. Twenty-nine people were rescued, and 12 bodies were recovered. In a separate operation, two women found swimming at sea told rescuers that 128 other people had died in their wreck, the AP reports. UNHCR emphasized that the number of dead was an estimate. In both cases reported Thursday, most people on board appeared to have been sub-Saharan Africans. UNHCR said the increased number of deaths this year is partly due to the fact that smugglers are often using rubber dinghies, which are prone to deflating, capsizing, and losing people who fall overboard. In addition, more migrants are arriving with severe burns from being exposed to fuel mixed with sea water in the bottom of the dinghies.

Ka'iulani Murphy, an apprentice navigator on the double-hulled canoe, told the AP that the journey taught her the value of ancient Polynesian maritime techniques.  We really are sailing in their (the ancestors') wake,  said Murphy, 38.  We had to re-learn what our ancestors had mastered.  The voyage perpetuated the traditional wayfinding that first brought Polynesians to Hawaii centuries ago. Hokulea, which means star of gladness, was built in the 1970s, when there were no Polynesian navigators left. So the Polynesian Voyaging Society looked beyond Polynesia. Mau Piailug, from a small island in Micronesia, was among the last half-dozen people in the world to practice traditional navigation and agreed to guide Hokulea to Tahiti in 1976.  Without him, our voyaging would never have taken place,  per the Hokulea website. Crewmembers hope the latest journey will inspire other indigenous cultures to revive traditions. Hawaiian ancestors also farmed and fished sustainably.  They figured it out—how to live well on these islands,  said Nainoa Thompson, master navigator and society president.  And I think that is the challenge of the time for planet earth and all of humanity.",

But the one that took center stage Friday in Durham, NC, focused on her husband, novelist Mike Peterson, who filed what's called an Alford plea on a voluntary manslaughter charge, more than 15 years after his wife's body was found at the bottom of the stairs in their home, the News & Observer reports. The case, which became the subject of a lengthy documentary, features intriguing details, including family members who've switched sides and even a family friend in Germany who, like Kathleen, was found dead at the bottom of the stairs a few years before Kathleen (and whose daughters Mike Peterson ended up raising). Peterson, 73, was originally convicted in 2003 of first-degree murder and sentenced to life in prison without parole, but he was released in 2011 after the judge who'd presided over the original case ruled that a main prosecution witness had lied, WRAL and the AP report. A new trial was ordered. The Alford plea entered by Peterson Friday allows him to still claim innocence while conceding the prosecution has enough evidence to get a guilty verdict. He walked out free afterward, though his wife's sister declared in court,  You will be a convicted felon forever.  Peterson had said earlier he didn't want to take the plea, but he didn't think he'd ever get a fair second trial by prosecutors.  I am not going to put my life and my freedom in their hands.

Bad news: The distribution of that new wealth was as uneven as ever. According to Credit Suisse's 2017 Global Wealth Report, the richest 1% now account for a record 50.1% of all global wealth, approximately $140 trillion, up from 42.5% in 2008. Meanwhile the poorest 70% of adults have just 2.7% of global wealth—that's about 3.5 billion adults with less than $10,000 in assets each, the Guardian reports.  The outlook for the millionaire segment is more optimistic than for the bottom of the wealth pyramid,  Fortune quotes the report as stating. There were 2.3 million new millionaires created in 2017, bringing the total to 36 million millionaires worldwide. That's nearly triple how many there were in 2000. But the divide isn't just between the haves and have-nots; it's also geographical and age-related. Wealth in Africa actually fell by 1.9% per adult this year. In North America, it grew by 8.8% per adult. And more than 40% of the world's millionaires live in the US. Meanwhile Credit Suisse chairman Urs Rohner warns of the  millennial disadvantage.  He says  millennials face particularly challenging circumstances,  with baby boomers hogging housing and top jobs, and have had little chance to accumulate wealth. The younger generation, stuck with students debt and paying for the pensions of baby boomers, are expected to do less well financially than their parents.",

Doctors were prepping her for cataract surgery, injecting anesthesia, when they found and removed the lenses. The woman, said to be in her mid-60s, hadn't complained of eye irritation, but she explained after the contacts were removed that  she thought her previous discomfort was just part of old age and dry eye,  one specialist trainee ophthalmologist tells Britain's Optometry Today.  When she was seen two weeks after I removed the lenses, she said her eyes felt a lot more comfortable,  she adds. The cataract surgery was delayed so that bacteria that had accumulated in part of the eye could clear. The report, published in the British Medical Journal, could offer a warning not only to contact-wearing patients who go long stretches without eye exams, but to optometrists as well, since the clump of lenses hadn't caused an obvious infection. If such an incident did lead to an infection, a person could lose her sight, the specialist trainee warns. In this woman's case, doctors say her  deep-set eyes  could be part of the reason so many contacts—which were bound together by mucus, per Time—could have accumulated without notice.",

The alleged victims told police in 1994 that the women, who are openly gay, assaulted them at Ramirez's apartment but their testimony varied wildly, reports the San Antonio Current. Ramirez was later sentenced to 37.5 years in prison, while the others were sentenced to 15 years. Vasquez was paroled in 2012, while the others were granted bail a year later, after one of the two alleged victims recanted and the state's witness retracted her testimony. Earlier this year, a state district court judge overturned their convictions, which came at a time of anti-gay bias and  national hysteria … over satanic sexual abuse,  reports KSAT. But the judges on Wednesday found the woman, all in their 40s,  have unquestionably established that they are innocent,  and noted the father of Ramirez's nieces  has engaged in a pattern of threatening behavior towards the complainants and false allegations of sexual assault.

The GOP blew past its self-imposed deadline for public release, with the rollout now set for Thursday. Trump set an ambitious by-Christmas timetable for passage of what he hopes will be the first major rewrite of the US tax system in three decades. Tax writers decided to maintain the highest personal income tax rate at its current 39.6% and to slash the corporate tax rate to 20% from 39%, the AP reports. They strained to complete other last-minute changes, but they failed to finalize details to meet their Wednesday deadline for a public release.",

        "news": "(Apr 17, 2017  3:33 PM CDT) Opening his first White House Easter Egg Roll, President Donald Trump extolled the strength of America as thousands of kids, and some adults, reveled in the time-honored tradition of rolling hard-boiled eggs across the manicured lawn in his back yard.  This is the 139th Easter Egg Roll. Think of it, 139,  Trump said Monday, welcoming families to the annual event, which the AP reports was dampened by intermittent rain.  And we will be stronger and bigger and better as a nation than ever before. We're right on track,  he said, speaking of the nation's strength under fewer than 100 days of his leadership. Trump's wife, Melania, and their son, Barron, 11, and the Easter Bunny joined him on a balcony overlooking the expansive lawn before they went downstairs to join some of the 21,000 people who were expected to attend what is the biggest social event every year at the White House. Before joining the festivities with his family, Trump thanked his wife for  working on this for a long time to make it perfect.  There was, however, some speculation about whether the Trumps would be able to pull off a successful  egg-stravaganza.  Planning seemed to get off to a late start, with the Trumps taking longer than in previous years to announce Monday's date. Both Trump and the first lady have been slow to fill White House jobs, and at least one regular egg roll vendor took to Twitter, the president's favorite social medium, to remind the White House that a deadline for ordering the wooden eggs that are given out as souvenirs was approaching. But the egg rolling event, which dates to 1878, wouldn't be made to disappear. It was just made smaller, down from the 35,000 people who got tickets last year. Click for more on the festivities.",

        "news": "(Jul 6, 2017  2:25 AM CDT) Police in South Carolina say they're searching for an inmate who's extremely dangerous—and has managed to break out of a maximum-security prison for the second time since he began serving a life sentence in 2004. Jimmy Causey, 46, has been missing from the Lieber Correctional Institution since around 2pm Wednesday, the AP reports. In his previous escape, he broke out of the Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia in 2005 with convicted murderer Johnny Brewer by hiding in a trash truck. After three days on the run, they were recaptured at a motel 100 miles away on Interstate 95 when a pizza delivery driver recognized them and tipped off authorities. Residents near the Ridgeville, SC, prison have been urged to  remain vigilant, keep vehicles and homes secured  while the search continues. Causey, who first went to state prison for grand larceny in 1992, is serving a life sentence for kidnapping prominent Columbia attorney Jack Swerling and his wife and daughter, the Post and Courier reports. He held the lawyer—who had represented him in previous cases—at gunpoint and demanded money. During the trial, the court heard that Swerling had managed to get reduced sentences for Causey on two occasions in the 1990s, but Causey still held a grudge about having been sent to prison at all.",

        "news": "(Jan 10, 2018  7:12 AM) The biggest controversy surrounding Ridley Scott's latest movie used to be the replacement of disgraced actor Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer. Now, new commotion surrounding All the Money in the World, with USA Today reporting a good portion of the money in the reshoot budget went to Mark Wahlberg, not co-star Michelle Williams. Sources say that after the Spacey-Plummer swap, Wahlberg received $1.5 million in the scramble to reshoot his scenes, while Williams racked up less than $1,000 from her $80 per diem—0.07% of Wahlberg's take. Both actors are repped by the William Morris Endeavor agency. Scott told USA Today last month the $10 million reshoot was possible only because  everyone did it for nothing  and  they all came in for free.  However, behind the scenes, Wahlberg's team had scooped up the big fee for him, and Williams apparently had no clue. Both moviegoers and fellow stars railed against the news underscoring Hollywood's gender pay gap, HuffPost reports; it also notes that, looking carefully at the December USA Today interview, Scott never mentions Wahlberg's name in the  working for free  column. An entertainment writer points out Williams is considered the film's lead actress, while Wahlberg is a supporting actor. Actress Amber Tamblyn deemed the news  totally unacceptable,  while director Judd Apatow tweeted,  This is so messed up that it is almost hard to believe. Almost. This is how this business works.  He then added:  I wonder if the studio or Wahlberg will do something to make the situation less insane.  Others online agree, saying the award-winning Williams should get a retroactive fee. Newsweek notes that Wahlberg was named the highest-paid actor in the world in an August Forbes article, making $68 million in 2017.",

An already slow August came to a screeching halt at the multiplex, where no major new releases were unveiled, per the AP. That left the Samuel Jackson-Ryan Reynolds action-comedy The Hitman's Bodyguard to top all films for the second week with an estimated $10.1 million in ticket sales. The horror film holdover Annabelle: Creation followed in second with $7.4 million in its third weekend. The Conjuring spinoff has now grossed $77.9 million in total. The Weinstein Co. animated release Leap! was one of the few new films to hit theaters. It earned a scant $5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. The entire slate of films grossed only about $65 million, the lowest total since September 2001.",

        "news": "(Apr 27, 2017  9:21 AM CDT) One of the letters was said to have been to Aaron Hernandez's fiancee, a second to his young daughter. But the nature of a third suicide note Hernandez is believed to have left behind remains shrouded in mystery—and now the lawyer of Kyle Kennedy, who says he was a  close friend  of Hernandez in prison, says his client wants that third letter (which he believes was written to him) released, NBC News reports. Attorney Larry Army Jr. also said at a Wednesday presser that Kennedy would eventually reveal the  nature and extent  of his relationship with the ex-Patriots player. But sources tell TMZ the third letter was actually penned to Hernandez's lawyer, Jose Baez, who issued a statement Tuesday via NBC's ProFootballTalk bashing whispers of a letter  to a gay lover, in or out of prison  as  false  and calling the rumors  malicious leaks used to tarnish someone who is dead.  Per the Boston Globe, however, Army says the letter may have been written in a kind of prison code, and that his client may have been referred to by his prison nickname. Army also revealed Hernandez had referenced suicide weeks before his death in a different letter to Kennedy, writing,  I think I'm going to hang it up.  He adds his client wants a $47,000 watch he says Hernandez gave him, the AP reports. Rumblings about the men's relationship began after a Newsweek story claiming the third letter was left to Hernandez's  prison boyfriend,  subsequently ID'd by the Daily Mail as Kennedy, who's serving a sentence for armed robbery. The Worcester County DA's office hasn't been much help, with a rep telling NBC Monday,  The information I have is unclear.  Kennedy released a statement with condolences for Hernandez's family, saying,  I miss my friend, Aaron Hernandez,  per NBC.",

As Politico reports, major media outlets are abandoning the time-honored practice of scooping each other in order to combine reporting forces in the name of making sure Election Day is as clean as possible.  It’s an entire national newsroom, essentially only looking at problems facing people who vote,  says a senior reporting fellow at ProPublica, the nonprofit which gave birth to Electionland earlier this year and was quickly joined by the likes of the New York Times, USA Today, and Google News Lab, as well as scores of more regional media outlets like the Arizona Republic, Miami Herald, and the Virginian-Pilot. Notable among those who declined to partner up: CNN and the Associated Press. Yet it's what Quartz calls  an unprecedented gathering of journalists,  and includes newsrooms set up at City University of New York and at 13 journalism schools. On Tuesday, Electionland will watch social media, Google search trends, and data from the Election Protection project, as well as receive reports from reporters on the ground.  This is a really interesting experiment,  says a politics editor at USA Today.  I don’t know exactly how it’s going to work. I don’t think any of us do. It seems like the right thing to do.  Adds Snopes' managing editor:  It's going to be a sh-- show.",

        "news": "(Oct 31, 2017  12:10 PM CDT) Legendary mountain climber Fred Beckey, who wrote dozens of books and is credited with notching more first ascents than any other American mountaineer, has died. He was 94. Megan Bond, a close friend who managed his affairs, told the AP that Beckey died of natural causes in her Seattle home Monday. She described him as a  brilliant writer  and  extraordinary mountaineer  with  a personality and humor that almost dwarfed the mountains around him.  But though he  made as many as a thousand ascents that no one was known to have taken before,  the German-born climber who immigrated to Seattle, Wash., as a child, avoided publicity and was  virtually unknown to the general public,  reports the New York Times. Choosing mountains over people (he never married or had kids), Beckey often climbed 50 peaks in a single year. In 1942, he and his younger brother, Helmut, wowed the climbing community with an impressive second ascent of Mount Waddington in British Columbia. He went on to accomplish hundreds of first ascents on peaks throughout the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, Canada, and Wyoming. In 1954, he established new routes on three of Alaska's mountains: McKinley, Deborah, and Hunter.  Fred was a true American icon  and  inspired countless people to explore this amazing planet,  says Dave O'Leske, who spent the past decade filming Beckey. Even in his 90s, Beckey was still plotting routes and climbing. Bond said they were planning a trip to the Himalayas next spring.",

The crowd cheering wildly with every winner he hit, Federer then broke Nadal again in the eighth game to go up 5-3. Nadal had chances in the next game, but couldn't convert on two breakpoint chances and Federer closed it out on his second match point. Federer jumped up and down and screamed in celebration after clinching the match, then held back tears as he sat in his change-over chair. Federer, who is 35, captured his first major title since Wimbledon in 2012 and his fifth Australian Open trophy. Nadal had been bidding for his second title in Melbourne and his 15th overall at Grand Slams.",

        "news": "(Apr 10, 2017  9:41 AM CDT) Just three months after welcoming a child together, Janet Jackson and husband Wissam Al Mana are splitting up, according to multiple sources including People and Page Six. The singer and the billionaire Qatari businessman wed in 2012, and TMZ notes that the separation appears to have come exactly at the five-year mark of the marriage—which could have financial implications if the pair had a prenup. Al Mana, 41, is worth significantly more than Jackson, 50, and prenups typically allot more money to the spouse the longer the marriage goes on; they usually include 5- and 10-year marks at which more money is doled out. Their new son, Eissa, could also have prenup implications, TMZ notes. Why the split? Page Six's sources are conflicted, with one claiming the split is amicable and the other saying Jackson thought Al Mana  had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts.  She also moved to London at his request—and her mother, Katherine Jackson, recently spent two months there with the family, which the source says is a factor in the split. Janet is worried about her mom, who alleges elder abuse at the hands of her nephew Trent, and the source says she's frustrated that her husband doesn't seem to share her concerns. The split news was reported soon after Katherine Jackson returned to LA. But TMZ says she may not actually have gone to London in the first place to get away from Trent, but rather because of the looming separation.",
